Very nice basic clothing.  I think the size is fine.  I really like being able to find these shades of green, though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color.  This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens

Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.  Thanks!!

I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while. I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that.

I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure!

These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat).

Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen.

The quality is much better than expected. I bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our Las Vegas trip Sept. 6, 2005. We were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities, our cell phones, travelers checks, keys, and medicines in particular. We love the spacious divided compartments. I highly reccommend this product..

I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can't be worn with a bra...but the nipple issue was quite vexing. I didn't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion...the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply. But, problem solved. These things rock

The collar stays are great!  They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts.  The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly

I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open  nearly to the waist, and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little, nobody would be able to see anything. The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin, so they were perfect. They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold. The best part was, they didn't feel weird at all

About 18-24 months ago, we purchased a pair of beach CROCS for our daughter, child-toddler size 12-13, like those pictured. She has used them for the beach, around the pool, wearing them to school on non-gym days, going on non-strenuous walks, and so forth. Plus, we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools. Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2, she still wears them. And, the shoes are in good shape! Also, daughter's mother has been wearing her own pair, for similar uses, for about two years. So, we highly recommend CROCS

I can only ditto what the other 5-star reviewers have already said. I have 1 of the 41" for summer and now 2 of the 50" for fall and winter. The colors remain solid after mutiple washes, and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts. Also very comfortable. Highly recommend! ngmackie, Dunwoody, GA

must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers. i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems. very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation.  very good looking comfortable shoes .  only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support --these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer-- but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them

My mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels. So, I bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it! And I quote "It is practical and functional and makes a huge difference (re: comfort) for those long international flights." Big hit!

I'm taking off one point only because these pants don't have the short/medium/long choice as other BDU pants do.  I'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline.  For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34'' and inseam up to 34-35''.  For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.  I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend.

Other than that I'm happy with the product quality and the service I received

My husband loves this coat. He wears it all winter. If you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it. He is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect. Warm enough and lightweight and comfortable. THis is the second one he has purchased.

I have been using this for awhile now.  Unlike some sports bras that are this supportive, it's a lighter weight material/construction.  I wouldn't say that there probably isn't something better out there and it isn't cheap - but it's not bad.  For my peers that have this 'issue', you know what I'm talking about!:

Before this bra, I would have to wear an underwire bra, and a sports bra on top to minimize bounce. My cup size is F, so it's been difficult to find a sports bra that I can wear standalone. 

Well folks, I found it. THIS IS THE BRA!! I wore it while doing turbo jam today and it was AMAZING! It did better than the two bra combination ever did. If you're looking for a sports bra that actually WORKS, this is the one

I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.
The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body.
The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams. 
As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing.
I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.  Due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site, I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag.  I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms

I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.

After purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's "customs broker" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.

I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.

The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. 

The gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.

The bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.

Overall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit

I never buy stuff like this on line.  I like to play with/feel wallets before getting them.  But I couldn't find a thin, bi-fold that I liked, so I took a chance.
It's great.  The ID feature is super handy (it comes all the way out if you're wondering).  And the brown leather is soft and nice.  It is really nice for the price.
(By the way, personally, I don't think it's thick at all)

I had never ordered from this company before. I have now ordered quite a few things from them. For the price, everything has been very attractive. Some of the sizes run a bit small.

This dress is very sweet, the PAPRIKA color is an orange, but I ordered 3 of these in different colors. Nice to wear around the house during the summer.( I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT, but it is really brown, alright with me, a nice dress.)

Customer Service was very good to me, and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions, as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News.

I am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things. Shipping was very speedy.

For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman's, Sak's, or Bloomie's  - but you get many more nice, simple, summer dresses, of a decent quality. I think that Newport News offers good value, and service for the money

I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The jeans are great quality for the price. However, it was not stated that they would be the (very)long length that they were. I had to alter them, which was an inconvenience

Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.

I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.

As for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience. In Nike, Reebok, Gap, and Rusell Athletic tshirts, I wear a large. I wear a large in Artiga as well, and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing

I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part.

Nice, soft leatherette. The inside is roomy, and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio. The tie-front detail stays so, you don't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening. Nice silver buckle accents on strap. Great

I ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews. I was not disappointed! The bag is large and roomy, made of heavy-duty material, with outside pocket, and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys, etc. for easy finding.  It will make the perfect beach bag for us, and could be used for almost anything.

I purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas. I was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots. With four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when I saw these at a more reasonable price, I got them. When she opened them, she at first didn't even realize they weren't the ugg's. She has been wearing them since and I'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost. In comparison to the more expensive boots, she says "no difference"

i've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily, sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes. my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here, after months of searching! the heel is nice and soft but there's still sufficient support here (for me that is. for those of you out there with back problems, it might not be sufficient). i got them in the gold, which is a gorgeous pale lame, and am currently lusting over the black :

As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present "one size fits all,"it becomes increasingly difficult
for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in
anything other than the most expensive brands. These shoes
are well made and an excellent value. The only negative
is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer
to make them narrow. The heel tends to wallow a little bit in
my particular case

I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug. But otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined. I just love this modern addition,and it's not too "young" feeling, just right.

They look nice and feel AMAZING.  I bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more.  They're great and the cushion doesn't 'flatten out' in the wash

My friend was very happy with them.  They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part.  The only issue we had was the length of the arms.  They were a little too long.  Other than that, we were pleased.  They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted

Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up

It's a very durable bag. I run trails a lot and I was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season, durable as well as comfortable, and cheap so I don't have to worry about ripping it. The straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders. The part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills. And if you need it for books, the padding will keep the books from poking your back. I would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though.  
I expect I will tear it to shreds eventually, but for the price it's worth it.

i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip (along with the 20" nxt roller) and i'm very happy with it.  the styling and fit is excellent, and it holds more than i expected.  it's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder.  i purchased the black version.  with victorinox's lifetime guarantee you can't go wrong!  amazon.com is very competitive on price on this bag, and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them

It's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different. Cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality. I think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite. By the time I finished hemming them, I didn't have that cute slit at the bottoms. They wash well and wear well

This jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip. This is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect. It will keep you perfectly dry. You will sweat a little on a warm day, but it is well worth the money for a cheap, dependable and totally waterproof suit. enjoy the rain and mud.

I own lots of shoes...but I don't wear them...truth be told, I detest having things on my feet. I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my "Birks". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them "Birks" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.

I own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the "nice ones". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.

I'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. 

Are they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.

So get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.


I firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy. So bless your soles with a gift from the gods. You'll be glad you did.

I LOVE this shoe! 
It's a perfect heel height, classic pointed toe, comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot. Perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort.

If I win Lotto, I plan to order every color with spares in case it's ever discontinued.

The natural leather is lovely, but scuffs easily. I strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability.

HIGHLY recommended, even for wider feet!

Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. 

I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.

I purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color.  They were so comfortable that I purchased two more pair in different colors!  The straps are VERY comfortable - they're elastic and not tight or constraining.  The shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes.  I can wear these shoes for both the AM and PM services to church, where I usually have to wear a different pair for the PM service because my feet hurt so bad!  It's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels, so when you can find them, stock up on them

This purse has a lot of positives going for it:
1. Great design - the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous.
2. The color is very glamorous.
3. It is a deal at this price (although I bought it when it was $5 higher)
4. It is unique and I love it because I am unique :)

In short, I love it

I have arms like a gorilla, so I was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves. They fit even my appendages nicely. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and I'm glad I did, for the large is a perfect fit on me, and I'm pretty slender. The material is fairly thin, but not see-through. Overall, I say this shirt is a good value

This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport, but beware, it runs really narrow.  I even went a size up from my usual to compensate.  I ended-up sending them back anyway.  So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal

This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's "Lecons de Seduction" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this "tanga" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us

I originally started wearing Hanky Panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back. Recently I stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again I'm thrilled.

I wear low rise jeans, shorts, etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when I bend over or pick something up. I never feel as though I need to reach back to check to see if I'm giving a show or not! They're just as comfortable as the others -- the just ride lower on your hips. They're very sexy too!

I suggest ordering from Bare Necessities b/c they offer free shipping with any $40 purchase. That's three pairs of thongs -- you can't beat that. And... once you try these you'll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color!

Go for it!!!

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. I will never forget that day.

The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.

I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes.

My suggestion is to wear them sparingly.

I love this shoe! It looks very elegant on the foot and there's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus! But make sure to go half a size up. It's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in.

I love Puma shoes--especially the Future Cat Low.  Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I've ever had.  The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average, but you get what you pay for.  They are great-looking and are extremely comfortable.  I am so pleased with these shoes that I plan on only purchasing sneakers from Puma from now on.  I've bought four different Future Cats: dark shadow/persimmon orange, black/white/Chinese red, white/black/vapour blue, and black coffee/white/burnt olive

Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials. 

Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. 

Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this "no-show." I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) 

For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. 

This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not "cling" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. 

The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. 

May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier! 

I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection

Purchased these for my husband. He absolutely loves these sandals. He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange. However, he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard. He uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors. Wears them every day. Thanks for a nice slip-on! Also these are sturdy though very light weight

These are exactly what I was looking for.  I've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years.  Everytime I break or lose a pair I spend months looking for its replacement.  After I received my first pair, I ordered enough to last me another 20 years.  I hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days.  They are uncomfortable and they cost more

I bought these because I normally can't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert. These are great. Very comfortable. I plan on living in them this summer.
I bought a size 8 croc which was fine. These were on the big size so I exchanged them for the next smaller size. I guess I am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes, go smaller with the Athens Croc

This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank.

My 11 year old wanted these shoes. All her friends at school thought they were so cooland want a pair. Plus they slip on and off so quick and are great for PE and the palyground. I would buy these shoes again, without a doubt. Keds makes a wonderful product and I think she'll out grow them before they even think about wearing out. Great value for the money.

I just received this bag today and I am absolutely in love with it.This bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is HUGE!!! With a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player. My husband got it 100% right with this little surprise. So if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price!!!

I have just recieved my pair of boxer-briefs for my son.  I took A kid's review's idea and got one size smaller for my son.  I asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good.  I asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me, I don't know why, but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer-briefs and take it out without the boxer-briefs streching and loosing their tightness

This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box.  It looks great with a skirt or slacks.   My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy.  I have the shoe in black.  If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available

Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside.  These slippers have been wonderful.  They fit her well, they stay on and they keep her feet warm.
When she wears these out will definitly by another pair

Podria ser extrano regalar una prenda de ropa intima, pero estos Boxer son lo maximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un companero de estudios, y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas. Son de algodon, muy suaves frescos y ligeros. Los compre talla M y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno M de Medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad. Para mi gusto son un poco largos, pero eso tambien provee de comodidad a su usuario. esto es mas que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir. El estampado fue toda una celebracion "Saluda a mi pequeno amigo"!!!!!!, con este Boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar

They are exactly what I was hoping they would be.  I love the contoured front pouch.  All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal.  I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit.  My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel.  I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico's and they're all good quality and look and feel great

This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy and comfortable

I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly.

In effect, they give you "drawers" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else. 

The 18" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.

I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.

A standard-sized 21" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).  It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18" folders, depending on the clothes being packed.

I bought this bra because I was tired of seeing "nursing bra" lines under my shirts.  This is great.  I bought the L++ and it fits perfectly.  I am a 38DDD normally and durring my pregnancy a 40DDD was fitting too.  If you buy this bra, you will love it, just buy the correct size

Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.

I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the $20 coupon and as usual, scored with free shipping. Clarks' quality is tops and the prices were great, too!

I got these in earth color. They look really good with jeans. Comfy with or without socks. The soles are gonna last a while.

These have some nice cush to them, and provide good support to my high-arched, tired feet

i don't have a lot of experience with compression shorts, but i am very pleased with this product. the fabric does not lose compression over time (although i've only had them a short time). the fit is good, the fabric is comfortable. i've gotten into the habit of sleeping in them, and they work great for keeping you toasty. i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer

I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than $30, retail price, even on sale, was $60. The jacket arrived in about a week. Its nice and warm, very good quality. The upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. It fits great and looks good. Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. But all in all I'm very pleased

I bought these slippers as a Christams gift for my 16 year old daughter, she was very happy to get them as I guess they are the "in" thing for teenagers in her school. She loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy! Price is high, but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper, these are more like shoes than slippers. The sheep skin and wool lining is very sturdy and luxerious

This is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps, just like I used to do before I got bored with knitting. It's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me; I just cut off the tag and people think I made it myself. (Don't tell!) 

Not high fashion, but very warm and comfortable

I like Bike swimmer jocks. I think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you. This is all you need to keep you in place. They don't cover any more than they need to. They're all you need when you jog (I don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). The swimmer jock style in general is like that, regardless of the manufacturer. However, I'm giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon, polyester, and Coolmax. They are much softer and can whick better. Plus, there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors, such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit. Why not add to your fun when you jog?

I ordered this bra as well as the Olga Women's Perfect Fit Full Figure, black, 38DDD.  This bra provides much better lift, support and separation than the Olga.  I think it is because the cups are seamed.  I'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature (I'm 5'2"), and also has a large bra size (I'm a 36DDD).

I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great.

If you are a grandma on a budget, it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons.  I thought that this was a good buy at $7.99 for my 11-year old grandson for either his birthday or Christmas.  I would have given five stars, but there was not a complete list of teams offered

These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight.  They are also a shiny patent material.  These are the pluses.  The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot.  That is, the toe piece seems a bit long.  I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house.  I also do not think that they are really worth the price.  Yes, they are Tommy Hilfiger, but the name is all you are really paying for.  They are an okay shoe, overall - not my favorites

I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.  I've already placed another large order, as Christmas gifts for my friends!

This is a lovely, lovely bra.  It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing.  The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear.  The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor.  The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.  Yes, you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye, St. Olga

I bought it for my boyfriend for the gym.  He would carry all his extra gym clothes, wallet, keys, and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way.  He really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff. Not very many other products have that extra pocket.  Very sturdy material and the size is just right

I ordered these shoes the minute I saw them featured on a fashion segment on the Los Angeles morning news. I have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable, the better. I recieved them in the mail the other day and can't wait until it warms up a little so I can wear them (I'm in cold Chicago). They have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering, you could even dress them up. They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being. 

I ordered my true size, 7.5, and these feel almost perfect, maybe just a  little roomy, but I'm not going to bother exchanging them because I'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small. I haven't owned a pair of Keds since high school in the early 90s, nor have I tried any on since then because I was in denial of Keds being cool again, so I couldn't remember what size I used to wear -- but I'm very, very happy with these shoes overall

These are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck, to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. They're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet "breath" a little fresh air. Nice value for the price

Having sampled 100% cotton pinpoint shirts both on-line and from the stores themselves, my husband keeps returning to his favorite, the Land's End pinpoint.  Without a doubt, the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary! Now, when its time for new shirts, we don't think twice and go directly to Land's End and order.  They also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all

All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also

I bought this tank in red and the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt and received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38.

It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift

These Crocs are very unique. They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it. 

I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside.

In short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. Treat your feet and buy them today

Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)

I love Birkenstocks and when I saw the Eaton Clog at such a low price, well, say no more.  Once you know your size, you can buy Birkenstocks from anywhere.  I just never expected to find them on amazon.com.  They're a little dressier style than my usual Bostons and I just love them

We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. They are so easy to get on him, and we all know some are SO difficult. These slide right on while pulling the tongue. They are also wide enough for his "flinstone" feet, lol. They break in well for flexibility too.

I had the worst feet!  I ran my first marathon in May, and I was in a panic.  On my long runs in March and the first part of April I was going to quit!  My feet hurt so bad!  I was training on a lot of downhill runs, and therefore landed on the balls of my feet.  Ouch!  I think I would have been better off to run in nothing, than to wear what I had, which was a top of the line shoe.  I was desparate!  I found these Asics GT 2110 Men's Shoe (I'm a woman) and I felt 100% better!! I had support plus the cushion I needed for my sore feet, what an awesome shoe!!  I finished my marathon in them, I couldn't have done it without them.

This product is great. Their are a ton of different ways to use this bag. From rolling it to carrying it like a backpack. I would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other. It is great.

The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.

bought these several months ago at Ross Dress for Less in Oregon for $19.99 I love them I bought them in a off white since that was the only choice. Love the comfort of them, think the t-strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide and sloppy on my foot and the t-strap is cushioned so it doesn't hurt my wee toes, I wear a size 8-8 1/2 depending on the brand these say 39.5 don't know if that is correct sizing or not, I would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals, perfect for the beach or casual summer wear. I am a self-professed shoe addict and these are great for those days you want only comfort

These are by far my favourite yoga pants. Very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're SUPER comfy. So stretchy that they feel like a second skin. And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T-shirt riding up. And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street!
The biggest problem with these pants is that it's hard to want to wear anything else. I own some 4 pairs of these and LOVE them

These shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts, but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it.  The construction is very sturdy, and the pockets are a great bonus.  I loved the first pair so much that I bought a second pair

I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband, he LOVES it.  It's comfortable, fits well and looks new after multiple washings.  Along with my husband being happy I am VERY pleased with the service of Amazon.com.  I ordered one item from shop.com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when I got the watch it wasn't the watch that I ordered......they don't even sell the watch they were advertising.  To top it off their customer service was not good, when I called amazon's customer service they were very helpful and nice! Therefore you can understand how much I appreciated that the MULTIPLE items I ordered from Amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated, the products were all GREAT and the service was great!

These look great with jeans, though I'm not a fan with skirts. I bought the black and now wish I could find the bronze in my size. I normally wear a 9, and depending on the brand I sometimes need a wide, but these I found the 8.5WW fits perfectly - go figure. Naturalizer runs very, very narrow. I love, love these shoes. I can dance all night without pain =) They are very cushioned, the top straps do not cut at all, and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2" heel. I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW!

This is the first time I've ordered shoes without trying them on, but these shoes were exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in the department stores in my size.  I know the name Naturalizer so knew they would be good quality.  They fit perfect, and the price was right! Thank you Amazon

I was asked by my daughter to get these for Christmas. I got some for myself for my morning walks in -30C temps. They do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day, even when I have just gotten it done, and keep my ears toasty warm.  Great product and worth the money. My daughter is equally impressed.

These work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable! It doesn't say so on the box, so when I first got them I thought they were way too small for adult heads and I was quite annoyed - however, you can adjust them once you put them on, just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly

The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed. They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing. My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well. The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing.
Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers.
Haagar has done a terrific job again

I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles.

About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material.  One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much.

I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others

You can kind of see through them, kind of not. The skirt is like a nifty mini, the G-string is not uncomfortable. This outfit looks good on my girlfriends, looks good on me and it'll look good on you too

  Purchased for our 6 ft 7 son and he is very pleased with them. They fit very comfortable and are long enough so that they do not come out of his belt line

Russell!  I really wouldn't buy any other kind.  Too bad they don't make concert T-shirts!  Great material, long-lasting.  The best

These are very pretty without too much fluff. The leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab. I love them

This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). A good buy.  Comes in a black version, that is also great.  I've worn for working out, and just around town - good for both.

i'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them. i took them home, tried them on, and i was absolutely amazed. They are a bit of a low rise, but that only adds to the flattery. and i like my underwear that way. There are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to, and once you find the perfect fit, you can hardly even feel that it's there. I give it a perfect score, and i am definatley going to buy more of these

This item was as I expected as far as the description, it is the quality I expected and I am pleased with it.  However, I bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit (It fit the way I feared the 2-X would fit that's why I bought the 3-X).  Don't know if it was mis-sized or what

I bought another of Clark's sandals a few years ago, which is why I ordered them again. These sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair! There was no break-in period with these shoes..I just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters. I will buy more in other colors I'm sure. You can't go wrong with Clark's
