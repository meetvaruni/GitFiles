Very nice basic clothing.  I think the size is fine.  I really like being able to find these shades of green, though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color.  This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens

Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.  Thanks!!

I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while. I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that.

I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure!

These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat).

Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen.

The quality is much better than expected. I bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our Las Vegas trip Sept. 6, 2005. We were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities, our cell phones, travelers checks, keys, and medicines in particular. We love the spacious divided compartments. I highly reccommend this product..

I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can't be worn with a bra...but the nipple issue was quite vexing. I didn't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion...the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply. But, problem solved. These things rock

The collar stays are great!  They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts.  The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly

I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open  nearly to the waist, and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little, nobody would be able to see anything. The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin, so they were perfect. They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold. The best part was, they didn't feel weird at all

About 18-24 months ago, we purchased a pair of beach CROCS for our daughter, child-toddler size 12-13, like those pictured. She has used them for the beach, around the pool, wearing them to school on non-gym days, going on non-strenuous walks, and so forth. Plus, we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools. Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2, she still wears them. And, the shoes are in good shape! Also, daughter's mother has been wearing her own pair, for similar uses, for about two years. So, we highly recommend CROCS

I can only ditto what the other 5-star reviewers have already said. I have 1 of the 41" for summer and now 2 of the 50" for fall and winter. The colors remain solid after mutiple washes, and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts. Also very comfortable. Highly recommend! ngmackie, Dunwoody, GA

must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers. i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems. very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation.  very good looking comfortable shoes .  only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support --these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer-- but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them

My mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels. So, I bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it! And I quote "It is practical and functional and makes a huge difference (re: comfort) for those long international flights." Big hit!

I'm taking off one point only because these pants don't have the short/medium/long choice as other BDU pants do.  I'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline.  For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34'' and inseam up to 34-35''.  For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.  I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend.

Other than that I'm happy with the product quality and the service I received

My husband loves this coat. He wears it all winter. If you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it. He is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect. Warm enough and lightweight and comfortable. THis is the second one he has purchased.

I have been using this for awhile now.  Unlike some sports bras that are this supportive, it's a lighter weight material/construction.  I wouldn't say that there probably isn't something better out there and it isn't cheap - but it's not bad.  For my peers that have this 'issue', you know what I'm talking about!:

Before this bra, I would have to wear an underwire bra, and a sports bra on top to minimize bounce. My cup size is F, so it's been difficult to find a sports bra that I can wear standalone. 

Well folks, I found it. THIS IS THE BRA!! I wore it while doing turbo jam today and it was AMAZING! It did better than the two bra combination ever did. If you're looking for a sports bra that actually WORKS, this is the one

I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.
The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body.
The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams. 
As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing.
I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.  Due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site, I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag.  I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms

I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.

After purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's "customs broker" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.

I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.

The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. 

The gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.

The bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.

Overall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit

I never buy stuff like this on line.  I like to play with/feel wallets before getting them.  But I couldn't find a thin, bi-fold that I liked, so I took a chance.
It's great.  The ID feature is super handy (it comes all the way out if you're wondering).  And the brown leather is soft and nice.  It is really nice for the price.
(By the way, personally, I don't think it's thick at all)

I had never ordered from this company before. I have now ordered quite a few things from them. For the price, everything has been very attractive. Some of the sizes run a bit small.

This dress is very sweet, the PAPRIKA color is an orange, but I ordered 3 of these in different colors. Nice to wear around the house during the summer.( I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT, but it is really brown, alright with me, a nice dress.)

Customer Service was very good to me, and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions, as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News.

I am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things. Shipping was very speedy.

For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman's, Sak's, or Bloomie's  - but you get many more nice, simple, summer dresses, of a decent quality. I think that Newport News offers good value, and service for the money

I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The jeans are great quality for the price. However, it was not stated that they would be the (very)long length that they were. I had to alter them, which was an inconvenience

Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.

I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.

As for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience. In Nike, Reebok, Gap, and Rusell Athletic tshirts, I wear a large. I wear a large in Artiga as well, and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing

I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part.

Nice, soft leatherette. The inside is roomy, and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio. The tie-front detail stays so, you don't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening. Nice silver buckle accents on strap. Great

I ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews. I was not disappointed! The bag is large and roomy, made of heavy-duty material, with outside pocket, and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys, etc. for easy finding.  It will make the perfect beach bag for us, and could be used for almost anything.

I purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas. I was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots. With four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when I saw these at a more reasonable price, I got them. When she opened them, she at first didn't even realize they weren't the ugg's. She has been wearing them since and I'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost. In comparison to the more expensive boots, she says "no difference"

i've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily, sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes. my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here, after months of searching! the heel is nice and soft but there's still sufficient support here (for me that is. for those of you out there with back problems, it might not be sufficient). i got them in the gold, which is a gorgeous pale lame, and am currently lusting over the black :

As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present "one size fits all,"it becomes increasingly difficult
for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in
anything other than the most expensive brands. These shoes
are well made and an excellent value. The only negative
is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer
to make them narrow. The heel tends to wallow a little bit in
my particular case

I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug. But otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined. I just love this modern addition,and it's not too "young" feeling, just right.

They look nice and feel AMAZING.  I bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more.  They're great and the cushion doesn't 'flatten out' in the wash

My friend was very happy with them.  They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part.  The only issue we had was the length of the arms.  They were a little too long.  Other than that, we were pleased.  They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted

Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up

It's a very durable bag. I run trails a lot and I was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season, durable as well as comfortable, and cheap so I don't have to worry about ripping it. The straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders. The part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills. And if you need it for books, the padding will keep the books from poking your back. I would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though.  
I expect I will tear it to shreds eventually, but for the price it's worth it.

i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip (along with the 20" nxt roller) and i'm very happy with it.  the styling and fit is excellent, and it holds more than i expected.  it's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder.  i purchased the black version.  with victorinox's lifetime guarantee you can't go wrong!  amazon.com is very competitive on price on this bag, and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them

It's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different. Cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality. I think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite. By the time I finished hemming them, I didn't have that cute slit at the bottoms. They wash well and wear well

This jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip. This is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect. It will keep you perfectly dry. You will sweat a little on a warm day, but it is well worth the money for a cheap, dependable and totally waterproof suit. enjoy the rain and mud.

I own lots of shoes...but I don't wear them...truth be told, I detest having things on my feet. I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my "Birks". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them "Birks" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.

I own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the "nice ones". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.

I'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. 

Are they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.

So get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.


I firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy. So bless your soles with a gift from the gods. You'll be glad you did.

I LOVE this shoe! 
It's a perfect heel height, classic pointed toe, comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot. Perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort.

If I win Lotto, I plan to order every color with spares in case it's ever discontinued.

The natural leather is lovely, but scuffs easily. I strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability.

HIGHLY recommended, even for wider feet!

Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. 

I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.

I purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color.  They were so comfortable that I purchased two more pair in different colors!  The straps are VERY comfortable - they're elastic and not tight or constraining.  The shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes.  I can wear these shoes for both the AM and PM services to church, where I usually have to wear a different pair for the PM service because my feet hurt so bad!  It's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels, so when you can find them, stock up on them

This purse has a lot of positives going for it:
1. Great design - the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous.
2. The color is very glamorous.
3. It is a deal at this price (although I bought it when it was $5 higher)
4. It is unique and I love it because I am unique :)

In short, I love it

I have arms like a gorilla, so I was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves. They fit even my appendages nicely. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and I'm glad I did, for the large is a perfect fit on me, and I'm pretty slender. The material is fairly thin, but not see-through. Overall, I say this shirt is a good value

This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport, but beware, it runs really narrow.  I even went a size up from my usual to compensate.  I ended-up sending them back anyway.  So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal

This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's "Lecons de Seduction" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this "tanga" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us

I originally started wearing Hanky Panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back. Recently I stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again I'm thrilled.

I wear low rise jeans, shorts, etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when I bend over or pick something up. I never feel as though I need to reach back to check to see if I'm giving a show or not! They're just as comfortable as the others -- the just ride lower on your hips. They're very sexy too!

I suggest ordering from Bare Necessities b/c they offer free shipping with any $40 purchase. That's three pairs of thongs -- you can't beat that. And... once you try these you'll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color!

Go for it!!!

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. I will never forget that day.

The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.

I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes.

My suggestion is to wear them sparingly.

I love this shoe! It looks very elegant on the foot and there's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus! But make sure to go half a size up. It's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in.

I love Puma shoes--especially the Future Cat Low.  Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I've ever had.  The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average, but you get what you pay for.  They are great-looking and are extremely comfortable.  I am so pleased with these shoes that I plan on only purchasing sneakers from Puma from now on.  I've bought four different Future Cats: dark shadow/persimmon orange, black/white/Chinese red, white/black/vapour blue, and black coffee/white/burnt olive

Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials. 

Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. 

Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this "no-show." I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) 

For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. 

This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not "cling" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. 

The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. 

May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier! 

I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection

Purchased these for my husband. He absolutely loves these sandals. He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange. However, he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard. He uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors. Wears them every day. Thanks for a nice slip-on! Also these are sturdy though very light weight

These are exactly what I was looking for.  I've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years.  Everytime I break or lose a pair I spend months looking for its replacement.  After I received my first pair, I ordered enough to last me another 20 years.  I hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days.  They are uncomfortable and they cost more

I bought these because I normally can't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert. These are great. Very comfortable. I plan on living in them this summer.
I bought a size 8 croc which was fine. These were on the big size so I exchanged them for the next smaller size. I guess I am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes, go smaller with the Athens Croc

This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank.

My 11 year old wanted these shoes. All her friends at school thought they were so cooland want a pair. Plus they slip on and off so quick and are great for PE and the palyground. I would buy these shoes again, without a doubt. Keds makes a wonderful product and I think she'll out grow them before they even think about wearing out. Great value for the money.

I just received this bag today and I am absolutely in love with it.This bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is HUGE!!! With a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player. My husband got it 100% right with this little surprise. So if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price!!!

I have just recieved my pair of boxer-briefs for my son.  I took A kid's review's idea and got one size smaller for my son.  I asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good.  I asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me, I don't know why, but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer-briefs and take it out without the boxer-briefs streching and loosing their tightness

This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box.  It looks great with a skirt or slacks.   My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy.  I have the shoe in black.  If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available

Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside.  These slippers have been wonderful.  They fit her well, they stay on and they keep her feet warm.
When she wears these out will definitly by another pair

Podria ser extrano regalar una prenda de ropa intima, pero estos Boxer son lo maximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un companero de estudios, y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas. Son de algodon, muy suaves frescos y ligeros. Los compre talla M y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno M de Medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad. Para mi gusto son un poco largos, pero eso tambien provee de comodidad a su usuario. esto es mas que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir. El estampado fue toda una celebracion "Saluda a mi pequeno amigo"!!!!!!, con este Boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar

They are exactly what I was hoping they would be.  I love the contoured front pouch.  All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal.  I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit.  My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel.  I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico's and they're all good quality and look and feel great

This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy and comfortable

I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly.

In effect, they give you "drawers" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else. 

The 18" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.

I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.

A standard-sized 21" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).  It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18" folders, depending on the clothes being packed.

I bought this bra because I was tired of seeing "nursing bra" lines under my shirts.  This is great.  I bought the L++ and it fits perfectly.  I am a 38DDD normally and durring my pregnancy a 40DDD was fitting too.  If you buy this bra, you will love it, just buy the correct size

Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.

I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the $20 coupon and as usual, scored with free shipping. Clarks' quality is tops and the prices were great, too!

I got these in earth color. They look really good with jeans. Comfy with or without socks. The soles are gonna last a while.

These have some nice cush to them, and provide good support to my high-arched, tired feet

i don't have a lot of experience with compression shorts, but i am very pleased with this product. the fabric does not lose compression over time (although i've only had them a short time). the fit is good, the fabric is comfortable. i've gotten into the habit of sleeping in them, and they work great for keeping you toasty. i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer

I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than $30, retail price, even on sale, was $60. The jacket arrived in about a week. Its nice and warm, very good quality. The upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. It fits great and looks good. Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. But all in all I'm very pleased

I bought these slippers as a Christams gift for my 16 year old daughter, she was very happy to get them as I guess they are the "in" thing for teenagers in her school. She loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy! Price is high, but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper, these are more like shoes than slippers. The sheep skin and wool lining is very sturdy and luxerious

This is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps, just like I used to do before I got bored with knitting. It's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me; I just cut off the tag and people think I made it myself. (Don't tell!) 

Not high fashion, but very warm and comfortable

I like Bike swimmer jocks. I think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you. This is all you need to keep you in place. They don't cover any more than they need to. They're all you need when you jog (I don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). The swimmer jock style in general is like that, regardless of the manufacturer. However, I'm giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon, polyester, and Coolmax. They are much softer and can whick better. Plus, there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors, such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit. Why not add to your fun when you jog?

I ordered this bra as well as the Olga Women's Perfect Fit Full Figure, black, 38DDD.  This bra provides much better lift, support and separation than the Olga.  I think it is because the cups are seamed.  I'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature (I'm 5'2"), and also has a large bra size (I'm a 36DDD).

I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great.

If you are a grandma on a budget, it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons.  I thought that this was a good buy at $7.99 for my 11-year old grandson for either his birthday or Christmas.  I would have given five stars, but there was not a complete list of teams offered

These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight.  They are also a shiny patent material.  These are the pluses.  The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot.  That is, the toe piece seems a bit long.  I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house.  I also do not think that they are really worth the price.  Yes, they are Tommy Hilfiger, but the name is all you are really paying for.  They are an okay shoe, overall - not my favorites

I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.  I've already placed another large order, as Christmas gifts for my friends!

This is a lovely, lovely bra.  It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing.  The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear.  The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor.  The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.  Yes, you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye, St. Olga

I bought it for my boyfriend for the gym.  He would carry all his extra gym clothes, wallet, keys, and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way.  He really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff. Not very many other products have that extra pocket.  Very sturdy material and the size is just right

I ordered these shoes the minute I saw them featured on a fashion segment on the Los Angeles morning news. I have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable, the better. I recieved them in the mail the other day and can't wait until it warms up a little so I can wear them (I'm in cold Chicago). They have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering, you could even dress them up. They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being. 

I ordered my true size, 7.5, and these feel almost perfect, maybe just a  little roomy, but I'm not going to bother exchanging them because I'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small. I haven't owned a pair of Keds since high school in the early 90s, nor have I tried any on since then because I was in denial of Keds being cool again, so I couldn't remember what size I used to wear -- but I'm very, very happy with these shoes overall

These are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck, to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. They're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet "breath" a little fresh air. Nice value for the price

Having sampled 100% cotton pinpoint shirts both on-line and from the stores themselves, my husband keeps returning to his favorite, the Land's End pinpoint.  Without a doubt, the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary! Now, when its time for new shirts, we don't think twice and go directly to Land's End and order.  They also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all

All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also

I bought this tank in red and the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt and received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38.

It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift

These Crocs are very unique. They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it. 

I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside.

In short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. Treat your feet and buy them today

Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)

I love Birkenstocks and when I saw the Eaton Clog at such a low price, well, say no more.  Once you know your size, you can buy Birkenstocks from anywhere.  I just never expected to find them on amazon.com.  They're a little dressier style than my usual Bostons and I just love them

We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. They are so easy to get on him, and we all know some are SO difficult. These slide right on while pulling the tongue. They are also wide enough for his "flinstone" feet, lol. They break in well for flexibility too.

I had the worst feet!  I ran my first marathon in May, and I was in a panic.  On my long runs in March and the first part of April I was going to quit!  My feet hurt so bad!  I was training on a lot of downhill runs, and therefore landed on the balls of my feet.  Ouch!  I think I would have been better off to run in nothing, than to wear what I had, which was a top of the line shoe.  I was desparate!  I found these Asics GT 2110 Men's Shoe (I'm a woman) and I felt 100% better!! I had support plus the cushion I needed for my sore feet, what an awesome shoe!!  I finished my marathon in them, I couldn't have done it without them.

This product is great. Their are a ton of different ways to use this bag. From rolling it to carrying it like a backpack. I would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other. It is great.

The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.

bought these several months ago at Ross Dress for Less in Oregon for $19.99 I love them I bought them in a off white since that was the only choice. Love the comfort of them, think the t-strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide and sloppy on my foot and the t-strap is cushioned so it doesn't hurt my wee toes, I wear a size 8-8 1/2 depending on the brand these say 39.5 don't know if that is correct sizing or not, I would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals, perfect for the beach or casual summer wear. I am a self-professed shoe addict and these are great for those days you want only comfort

These are by far my favourite yoga pants. Very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're SUPER comfy. So stretchy that they feel like a second skin. And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T-shirt riding up. And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street!
The biggest problem with these pants is that it's hard to want to wear anything else. I own some 4 pairs of these and LOVE them

These shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts, but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it.  The construction is very sturdy, and the pockets are a great bonus.  I loved the first pair so much that I bought a second pair

I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband, he LOVES it.  It's comfortable, fits well and looks new after multiple washings.  Along with my husband being happy I am VERY pleased with the service of Amazon.com.  I ordered one item from shop.com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when I got the watch it wasn't the watch that I ordered......they don't even sell the watch they were advertising.  To top it off their customer service was not good, when I called amazon's customer service they were very helpful and nice! Therefore you can understand how much I appreciated that the MULTIPLE items I ordered from Amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated, the products were all GREAT and the service was great!

These look great with jeans, though I'm not a fan with skirts. I bought the black and now wish I could find the bronze in my size. I normally wear a 9, and depending on the brand I sometimes need a wide, but these I found the 8.5WW fits perfectly - go figure. Naturalizer runs very, very narrow. I love, love these shoes. I can dance all night without pain =) They are very cushioned, the top straps do not cut at all, and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2" heel. I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW!

This is the first time I've ordered shoes without trying them on, but these shoes were exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in the department stores in my size.  I know the name Naturalizer so knew they would be good quality.  They fit perfect, and the price was right! Thank you Amazon

I was asked by my daughter to get these for Christmas. I got some for myself for my morning walks in -30C temps. They do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day, even when I have just gotten it done, and keep my ears toasty warm.  Great product and worth the money. My daughter is equally impressed.

These work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable! It doesn't say so on the box, so when I first got them I thought they were way too small for adult heads and I was quite annoyed - however, you can adjust them once you put them on, just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly

The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed. They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing. My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well. The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing.
Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers.
Haagar has done a terrific job again

I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles.

About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material.  One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much.

I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others

You can kind of see through them, kind of not. The skirt is like a nifty mini, the G-string is not uncomfortable. This outfit looks good on my girlfriends, looks good on me and it'll look good on you too

This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). A good buy.  Comes in a black version, that is also great.  I've worn for working out, and just around town - good for both.

i'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them. i took them home, tried them on, and i was absolutely amazed. They are a bit of a low rise, but that only adds to the flattery. and i like my underwear that way. There are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to, and once you find the perfect fit, you can hardly even feel that it's there. I give it a perfect score, and i am definatley going to buy more of these

This item was as I expected as far as the description, it is the quality I expected and I am pleased with it.  However, I bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit (It fit the way I feared the 2-X would fit that's why I bought the 3-X).  Don't know if it was mis-sized or what

I bought another of Clark's sandals a few years ago, which is why I ordered them again. These sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair! There was no break-in period with these shoes..I just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters. I will buy more in other colors I'm sure. You can't go wrong with Clark's

This is a quality sweatshirt that I am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather. I have had trouble, in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . The only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . The service was excellent and I will return for more BEARS gear

the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing. [...] doesnt carry these products. they sell an adapter and then a usb cord. which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money.
i like not having to worry with an annoying adapter when i want to charge my Zen. just plug in and walk away, not fiddle with the adapter to make sure it is inserted properly.
the case is abit annoying. it catches lint like you wouldnt believe. but i'm not getting scratches and I HAVE A KICK STAND! i use that kick stand the most - its actually the main reason i bought this set.
the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the Zen actually did, so it was sent FAST.
i love this.
get it

I was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what I was looking for.  I have more than three electronic devices that I need easy access to - and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices.  The only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil.  I don't know how durable it will be, but I'm hoping, very!!

For the price, this is a good buy

These are without question, the best panties for wearing with slacks.  No line at the leg, no line accross the middle of your behind, and no riding up.  They are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant.  Sizing runs true to any other Maidenform pantie you've ever bought. Can be had cheaper at a Maidenform outlet store, but still well worth the price on Amazon.  Buy lots of them

My baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old.  I ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months.  They are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months. Hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture. You do have to tie your own knot on the top. Andrew Christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days, but within the shipping time specified

Whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying!  I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V-neck shirt.  Just know that it really is deep!  I'm only in my twenties but I almost feel like an older man when I wear this shirt; cut lower than other V-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out!  If your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can't get any more comfortable than it already is!  Honestly, I probably won't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home, but I still love it

It clearly says it is a MESH dress! I wore this for my wedding, outside in bright sunlight, and it certainly did not show everything, but do not expect it to be completely opaque, as it is a MESH dress with delicate lining.

As for the quality, it wore well, and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design. Very fairy-like and pretty, and I was pleased to wear it

This is a great hard-side suitcase for the price.  It is basic and simple, but seems quite durable and functional.  I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not "TSA" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.

I would buy this suitcase again

You can wear them without a nursing bra since there is a way to to keep the nursing pads in. They are also very comfortable.  I wore them some days all day because they really don't look like pajamas.  I got them in blac

I bought these to replace an identical pair that I've been wearing for ten years. I got the old ones in London, and they were made in England. This new pair was made in China.  They have changed...some for the good and some for the bad.  There is now more toe room, which I like. However, both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit. If you try to wear them too long when you first get them, they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet. Break them in slowly and you'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time.

The shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress.  However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase

Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin sox. I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's  wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room.  If they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and  smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now

I purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of Ugg-like boots. We looked in stores and other online shoe sites for Uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season, couldn't find her size.  We saw these on Amazon in her size and thought we'd try them out.  They were definitely worth it!  They are just as warm and comfortable as Uggs and since the price was so good, we were able to buy two pairs.  They are nicely made, comfortable, and attractive. She's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable. She is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots

Bought one, loved it, bought another one for my d-i-l, she loved it, bought one for my daughter, she loved it .....you're probably getting the picture now.  I bought the next size up for each of us, and it's wonderful with a shirt or light sweater underneath.  Oh, and did I mention the incredible price??

This workout is short but you will feel "worked out" when done.  Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly.  No awkward transitions.  The ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio.  Your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves.  I enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells.  Definitely "shocked" the muscles

As an advanced exerciser, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that. This workout comes with a sculpting ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! My arms really got a workout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonally across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the workout.
 
Once we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squats, and lunges, we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.
 
Tina leads, and she is very fit and quite personable. She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. As with all the new Firm releases, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercisers, with Allison showing beginner moves. Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusive.
 
Beginners will enjoy this workout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.
 
I have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good workout, but I wish it were longer. The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. 
 
Overall, I give this workout high marks. It's definitely a keeper

This is a VERY sexy pair of underwear. Guys: if you're new to the thong/g-string scene, this is a good place to start. I recommend g-strings because there's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs.

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear. Your girlfriend will love it. Mine did

As the weather has cooled for fall and winter, I needed socks for my baby. I initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn't hold up as well. I have also tried socks with grips on the bottom, but they were so thick my son just sweated in them. The Children's Place socks are not too thick and very durable. Also, the non-slip  feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked. The other socks did not! I strongly recommend these socks for your child

Before seeing it with my own eyes, I was a little skeptical of the huge buttons. After wearing it, I felt they were hardly noticable. I bought the brown version for $17.99 and I thought it was well worth it. This jacket is surprisingly wind resistant, ideal for cold weathers. The pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there

I love this boot.  It's high, and the platform will make those unaccustomed a little teeter-y, but it's a great look.  The leather and detail on my pair is exceptional.  Green leather inside.  I really like these.  And I own 55 pairs of shoes/boots - know from whence I speak

I've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school (35 years now), and the Lands End is the best.  I highly recommend this shirt

I really love the way these shoes look.  I am really picky about shoes I buy.  I dont like to have my toe cracks showing when I wear shoes and I was afraid that these might do that.  They actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is.  I wore these shoes all night on new year's eve and had no problem.  I also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high.  I love these shoes so much a have 2 pair, black and red.

I love the shoes, they're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what I like. They're a beautiful color, something you don't always see, and quite eye-catching.  And they just so happened to go very well with a suit I purchased months ago.  

As a "Nine West" Fantatic, thank you Amazon for having them available!

I was shocked to see how high the heel was, and being in my 40s I wasn't sure if I wanted to find out how they felt.  But I had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how "walkable" and comfortable they were.  I have worn them several times since then

have spent years looking for a bra that feels good, does what it's supposed to and didn't make you wish you could get home and slip out of something so uncomfortable... at last i think i'm at the end of my search.  very comfortable, great support and can go hours before i start thinking about jammies.  only thing that would make this bra better would be padded straps

I absolutely love this case! The cool thing about it is that it doesn't look like a regular laptop case (i.e. the bulky, usually black, boring, case). My best friend didn't even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself! It makes a great gift for any soon-to-be college student

This is a very nice leather bag.  It has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over.  The pockets do not close and I have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed.  That is the only problem I can see with this bag

These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.  This, however, is an important point, since I wear a size 10 shoe.  I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller.  One size does not fit all.

Columbia sport sandals for kids are great! We've bought them three years in a row now for our kids.

They hold up well, are comfy, and the colors are great.  Easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze.  

They're well constructed, but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while. They won't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size

This product is fine, however it was much too baggy.  I'm not that skinny and I felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with the short, but I just wish I had bought a smaller size.  Definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product.

I have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so I was very excited to find these. I bought 4 pairs (silver, bronze, black, and turquoise). They are beautiful and comfortable (I walked around at Disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight!) The sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast. I highly recommend both these sandals and Amazon.com

I purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago, and it's still in perfect condition!  The color doesn't fade when you wash it, and it's the most durable bag I've ever owned.  I will not, refuse to, absolutely cannot make me carry a purse, but I carry this bag everyday.  The very front zipper pocket is great for change, the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before, and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in.  It's perfect for everyday use, and will last forever. The "backpack straps" are comfortable and have never broken.  I was so excited when I found this on Amazon, and IN EVERY COLOR!  Before, the selection was red and black only, so this is fabulous!  Buy this bag, you will love it

These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too.

Amazon notes that these socks are "only made from the finest yarns." They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. 

The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!

I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will "bunch up" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.

Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal!

I ordered these robes (in white and ivory) as Christmas gifts for my mother and father-in-law.  They arrived quickly and beautifully packaged.  

Last week, I was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes - they feel as if they are at a spa.  I was concerned about the one size fits all sizing, but I was told that she loved the extra coverage (she's probably a size 14-16) and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline (I buy him XL sweaters).  

I will order one for myself as soon as I am in the market for a robe.

The robe is very warm and heavy, perfect for cold mornings and the "just out of the shower chills" that you get. It doesnt quite have the "luxurious" feel of a spa robe, and the thread loops are matted in certain areas, but quality wise it is better than anything else I've seen for similar prices. The length is much shorter than pictured. I bought this for my boyfriend, who is 6 ft, 190 lbs, average build, and it comes just above his knee! All in all, it's a decent robe for the price and he likes it.

I have ordered this tux for my 18 months old son for my sister's wedding. It looked amazing!!!

The suit arrived timely and I couldn't believe how perfect they have prepared the whole package. All the details were well thought and the tux looked perfect with satin buttons, matching waist band and stripes on the side of the pants. Even the shirt is so well tailored. 

My son was very comfortable in the suit during the whole night and accepted more applouds than the groom!

I sincerely recommend this product

I love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that I have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight.  I would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured

Agree 100%, very comfy. Besides making the ideal for everyday use, the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch. The look is very sexy. So they are good in both sides: comfy and sexy

For the price it's a nice dress.  Check your size carefully.  I'm normally a 29 waist in jeans, usually size 6, sometimes an 8.  I ordered a Large and it fits with only a little room, but a Medium would have been too small.  Slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than I expected it to.

I'm a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me. Ooooweee do I feel hot when I have 'em on. Levi's, shorts, dress or trucker's overhauls, it makes no difference. The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there, but you'll know and that's enough to add a certain blush to your face, let me tell you. They made me feel ready for bed all day long

I like this dress. I am medium sized and bought size Medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown, with even a little extra. I think even if I would of get size Small it would still fit well with more "trim fit" look. It is basically like a super long tank with body contour. Nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on, but also want to look good in it. (It is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend's long tea-shirt, if you understand what I am saying). It is soft, comfortable, cozy, beautiful color. I am very pleased with this product.

this is a great wallet! it fits into small purses. the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards, your id and a small zipper section for some money. it's not meant to be a complete, big wallet. i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around. i don't have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore. love it!

Absolute gems.  Simple, versatile shoes that are fun, comfortable, and have great casual style.  I have them in red, wear them to work, when traveling, and the one time I got stuck in a surprise Seattle snowstorm, they even had traction.  Nearly an all-purpose shoe.

My wife shopped around at Amazon looking for her grandmother's 88th b-day (coming up soon) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf.  Every silk scarf she came across she would say, "What a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are."  Before she found Vietmade Silk Scarfs at Amazon, she had looked online stores at Macy's, Nordstorm, JcPennies, but couldn't really compare with the ones Vietmade made.  I agree with my wife when she said, "This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices!!"  When we got the scarf today 4/10/07 (ordered 4/4/07) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself, one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law.  My wife and I definately recommend this place and we'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future.  Also, delivery was on schedule, good packaging and love the scarfs!

Great jacket, excellent feel. only qualms are the quality of the zipper and the big bright label on the inside of the jacket. 5 stars for the leather itself, soft and very comfortable. change the zipper so that it doesnt jam on the way up 99% of the time, and make the label much more subtle and this would be an awesome jacket!
also sad but not surprised to see this is made in chin

I'm shocked I forgot to write a review about these jeans. I love these jeans. They are by far my favorite jeans. The fit is perfect and allows for room to breathe. I love wearing these jeans with my boots on a daily basis. I can't say enough about them. I tell everyone about them. Even for a petite woman the fit is far better than anything I could find in a local store. I am completely satisfied. They also have a very modern look to them

This product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim (so many types of luggage are similar in style and color, we've had trouble in the past).  Several of our family members were given new luggage for Christmas and these tags were included. These tags are big, bright lime green and can be easily seen. No more headaches in trying to find our luggage.

Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. 

After getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.

The particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleeves

The outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. 

Once the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.

The first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.

Bottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.

This brown leather wallet does not have a highly glossy finish as shown in the image; leather is well-stitched but thin. Old-fashioned style with no credit card slots. Snaps and zipper handle add bulk to profile; not a front pocket wallet for sure. Purchased two as gifts for nephews, will probably get one for myself.

I actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9.  The 9 didn't fit well the arch was too short, so I sent them back and kept the 9.5.  They are very nice, I've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years.  I get a lot of compliments, from people of all ages (20-65).  Not too young looking, not too old looking.  They are the perfect boot.  One little negative....I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion.  After that I can wear them all day long.  I should have ordered them in brown!!

These sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and I just bought another one in a different color.  They feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed Napoletana designer, Ermenegildo Zegna.
But, as a general rule when buying Italian clothing, *always* buy them bigger than you would expect.  I normally wear a size large shirt in the US, never XL.  I am 5'7" and 185 lbs.  I bought a size 54 (x-large) and it is comfortably roomy, and not too "huggy" on the fat.   I think some of the similar sweaters from Zegna are more "delicate" (read: see-through).  This one is a little thicker, but still thin for a sweater.  I *really* like wearing it with a t-shirt underneath, feeling the soft cashmere on your arms.

We are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season.  
Unfortunately, the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails.  We do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching.  We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company, but we can not get anyone to respond.  We will never order anything through Amazon again

The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.

I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's been wearing it a lot.  He says it's comfortable, and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out.  I was hoping it has more of a dressier look.  It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki's

I have worn nothing but levi's for over 20 years now, and I have been through almost every style of them.  These are still the same great jeans, reliable fit and quality that you know.  Currently I have three of these in my closet nest to standard 505's, and they are virtually identical, but the signiture series cost a lot less. Same thick denim material, unlike a lot of fancy boutique jeans, that last a long time, and can stand up to most activities that an active person does.  Check these out, you won't be dissapointed, and neither will your wallet

I got this hat because it reminded me of what Jack Nicholson wore in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I'm happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm. Cashmere is very soft and it breathes well (my head never feels too hot)

I've tried 6 different nursing bras. This one, with the center snap closure, is the easiest to use. It is also the lightest and most comfortable, while providing good support. My only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric. Even when I try to sew it back into place, it breaks loose after a few washes. Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine, it would last longer. This bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras (particularly the Leading Lady bra, which seems to be indestructible), but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort, lightness, and ease of use. It is by far my favorite

I love these pajamas. The color, the softness (get softer the more you wash),and the fit. I had purchased these for an older friend and found I wasn't able to part with them so I made it up to her in other ways. Never done that before...shows how much I like 'em.

I bought Brown Burnished color of this variety. After I got them, I tried them on and these are, simply, fantastic. I liked the way they fit onto my feet. My feet are wide and hence I had ordered a wider version of these. They give you a very comfortable and stable feel when you have them on and walk around. The sole looks very sturdy and durable. Does not skid over wet surfaces

I hate long socks and smelly shoes so I've become a big fan of shoe liners.  I recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them.  They are each individually priced at $5.99.  So for 6 pairs you'd pay $36 retail.  So this is a good deal at $4/pair.

More importantly, they are heavy-weight cotton with no underside seam.  They have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet.  They are cut generously -- My feet are about size 8 and they are a little big, but manageable.  If you have smaller feet I'd try to get a different size than M/L.  They do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers, but a lower cut shoe could be problematic.

I've tried a lot of these socks:  Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Peds, Leggs, et al.  These are by far the best.

My online shoe shopping tip: Buy a half size bigger than your normal size.
If it's a little too big, you can always add inserts to achieve a better
fit.  I also search the web for additional consumer reviews.

PROS:
This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks!
It's an easy to put on short boot. 
(It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5)
The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.  
Stains will wipe right off.
I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young
professionals to wear with their slacks.
Relatively comfortable.  I personally wouldn't wear them all day long.

CONS:
Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking.
I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.  
The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather.
The zipper is not the best quality.

Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision!

* Or, you can always buy, try on and return.

I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding "it all" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet

I love my Cayman Crocs. My sister swore by these shoes, but I wasn't convinced because they are a little different looking. I liked the bright colors I saw some people wearing at the beach this summer, but I'm practical and they can only go with so many things. 
I ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything. I'm not at all disappointed. They really don't look bad paired with casual outfits. 
I wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it's amazing. It's not so much that you slip them on and say "wow this feels great" ... for me it was more so that after activities (marathon shopping trips for example) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit. I think they are great ... even with the "different" look ... though I do wish they'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point

I searched the Internet for a particular type of sock that my son likes, but discovered they were no longer manufactured.  So I went to Amazon to see what they offered and decided to try the Gold Toe.  The price was excellent and my son likes them very much.  (He's very finicky about some things and it was a real "if" to try something new)... I'm so happy that Amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they didn't work out.  My son has looked at the price of this sock at some of the department stores nearby and discovered that the Amazon price is very good; so now we know where to go when he needs some more.  Thank you, Amazon

My child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it.  I allowed it because he has not worn it outside.  Of course, he wore it the following day to school, rode his bike with it and just took it off at the end of the day.  

Very comfortable and cute shoes.  I might get a pair for myself

These shoes exceeded my expectations, in that they are very lightweight.  The soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber.  Time will tell how it wears compared to rubber, but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair I owned.   They look good, they are very comfortable--very little, if any, break-in time.  If you like the look, it's a safe buy--you won't be disappointed with the build and feel

So far I have been very satisfied with this bag. For the price I really can't complain. It has enough different sections, places for pens, a divider, pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use. 

I'm curious about the durability; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last. 

I use it to hold 2 1" notebooks, a textbook, a portfolio, a book, a calculator and my pda. This is about maximum capacity. I should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections.

The handle ontop is cozy, the over the shoulder strap should be wider. 

Overall, I am happy with the purchase, and hope that it lasts

It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning!  All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.

I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart.  I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.

I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.  It "flows" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe.  And the silk lining makes me feel "rich"!

Overall, I like it

The wand is sturdy, full-sized and nicely designed, even if made of plastic.  The kids wanted their wands so they could play "Harry Potter", so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available

The overall quality of the garment is excellent.  The fabric is of very good quality, as is the stitching.  The sizing is also accurate.  However, the tank top I received was NOT the one I had ordered, but a substitute!  Thus, four stars, not 5.  In the future I will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable

My husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots.  I also like the fact you can buy them in black and Amazon had a fantastic price on them.  I don't know the wearability of the socks since I just got them for my husband for Christmas.  I bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay - no holes in the toes, yet!  Overall, I think the socks are great.

These socks are really comfortable and they really stay up! All other brands of over-the-calf socks that I have tried won't stay over-the calf. Within a few hours, other socks are sitting on my shins. I have worn pairs of the Gold Toe Over the Calf Athletic Sock for up to 24 hours and the most they slid down my leg was about an inch. Great socks

This little scale can pay for itself many times over, and grants peace of mind as you approach check in.  I purchased two, one for my Australian friend who always overpacks and has to pay at the gate for overweight luggage.  It is more accurate than bathroom scales.  If you are by yourself, hold it in front of a mirror.

Was shopping at the mall.  This item caught my husband's eye in the window.  We went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it's uses.  We actually bought one for ourselves.  It came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland (going and returning home).  Especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight.  I was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn't.

We foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages.  It's a two-man operation.  My husband would lift the luggage/bag, then I would look at the scale quickly

I tried this shoe at Shoe Carnival today. It was on sale for $49.99. Needless to say, I bought it right away at Amazon since it was $39.99! It fit me really well, I walked around the store and the strap stayed fastened, it was comfortable all around. I really like the mesh material at the toe area. I'm hoping this would mean that my toes will be well ventilated during warmer summer months! This is a very comfortable trendy shoe that is a good option for those wanting to look hip while wearing something comfortable to include more walking steps in their work day. It's also a great shoe for those not wanting to expose their toes wearing sandals but want them to breathe.

We needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from Babies R Us.  The stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair.  We've got a Svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso, so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain.  Also, when cleaning, if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet, the bib would be cold and wet for hours.  The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for "bib goodies" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.  They can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast)

This bra is great for those of us with smaller busts.  It's the only bra I'll wear under my t-shirts now because it doesn't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra I've found.  It VERY comfortable.  The only downside is that mine did lose it's form (it's not as tight fitting as it used to be) a little bit faster than some other bras.  But, it's absolutely worth buying a replacement.  I just hope they never stop making this bra

I purchased 2 other bags before finding this one.  It is awesome.  The Canon S2 IS is a hard camera to find a case for that isn't way too tight or super big.  I wanted a bag for my camera and the original accessories that came with it.  This bag fits it all perfectly!!  It isn't too small or too big.  The camera fits perfectly without squishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the usb cord or whatever else you want to put in there.  I wouldn't recomend this bag if you are looking for a bag to hold additional lenses is, it isn't big enough for that

This is the best style and fit of underwear that I have ever owned. I have been buying this style for almost 7 years now. It gives me the support and freedom that I need in physical activity and the comfort I desire in everyday wear. Plus, it provides you with a nice lift and profile. 

Note, beware ordering through Freshpair. My order took 1 month from them

I was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years, yet wasn't going to take years to pay for!  (HA! HA!)  This is a nice checkbook cover for the money.  My only complaint is that it needs to have a "tab" to keep your check register open to the page you are working on.  However, it does have a "loop" to keep a pen inside, you should desire to do so.  All in all, a good buy

Best sock in performance that I have ever tried.  I buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed.  No sagging, no defects.  The only reason I toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use.

One of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again.  If they ever stopped making them, I would buy a 100 pairs just to know I would have them for my liftime.  

There...I actually wrote a review on socks!

This shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt.  It is unlined, has a bit of stretch for comfort, and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts. I think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen. I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter, and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt. It was almost thirteen dollars then, but I have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal

My daughter's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform.  I had an awful time searching the net to find any until I came across these.  They are very soft and comfortable.  My daughter only wants these types of socks from now on.  But from a Mom's point of view they are hard to keep white.  Even with soaking in bleach I can't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring.  Other than that, they're great

I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had. It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second. I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer. I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon.

Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money.  I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price.  Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less! For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don't want to send $90.00 and up for Shox

I was concerned that these silk PJ's would be really thin and on the cheap side. But to my surprise, they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.  

My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them.  I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them. Plus the fit was perfect.  I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size...and another person said the opposite.  (That confused me when I went to buy.) So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect!  :)  My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ's ever.  

The size is perfect, color bright and looks like it will hold up after many washings. Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past.  I can't find anything I don't like about these.  

I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out. lol  Anyone thinking of buying these I can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least.

I've had foot problems this past year. Shoes that I had worn comfortably for years, including other Rockports, Ecco, New Balance, Avia, Reebock, Asics, etc..., were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long.

These Rockports are great. I'm finally NOT in a hurry to get home and get into my slides. I was to the point that I'd pay $300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes. This shoe is well worth the money

Backpack is light when empty, yet strong to curry the load of books to school. Side pocket for bottle very handy. Top pocket for CD player or small easy to reach items such as keys, very helpful and practical. I like the base of the backpack being dark color so  it doesn't look dirty from use

This tee-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before.  I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt.  On the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in "hand" is worth the added function of "wicking" in this instance.  Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it.

This is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you're dressed in a short sleeve over this one.  However, I personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company.

Comfy, tough, lightweight, wrinkly (like me). Surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is. Good stitching. Velcro back pockets will save your wallet! Doesn't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear-freak cargo pockets. Not for the tidy country-club set who need creases on everything, but just perfect for active soccer Dads or when the family hound insists on playing Fetch with muddy logs and the like

So glad I didn't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them. This wallet is slimline and holds all my cards.
It's been 6 months since I wrote this review, and I only become more satisfied with this wallet. All my cards are easily accessed, viewed and I know immediately if one is missing. The leather is silky soft and durable. People have been asking where I found this item. I think it's the best I've ever purchased

We ordered this case for our son's Creative player, and it's a hit. It fits snuggly, he can access all the functions with no problems, and the loup allows him to attach it to a variety of cords and "leashes" during different activities. 

A great value for the money!

I wore these shoes when I worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet, ankles, knees and hips. I could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the "teeth" in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good. Being diabetic, I am very concerned about circulation and I believe this was a good purchase. A little expensive, but well worth it in the end. I plan on buying more

Please note, I did not find the need to order up many sizes.  I only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly.  Nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction, nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back.  I loves these boots and at a great price too.  Fast efficent shipping as well.  I should say that I bought a pair of White Mountain Suede Shearling boots and I was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality

These are the most comfortable briefs I have ever worn.  They are worth every penny, in my opinion.  They are designed for a man, plus they seem to not gather moisture, as some fabrics do

I was looking for the lightest, slimmest possible wallet, and the Dopp Getaway is just about perfect.  For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying "Dopp" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.

Overall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet.

This is my first Charles by Charles David shoe.  The material is good, the size too. The only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side, but it after 3 days using them it was ok.

Very nice shoe but definetly it is not a $100 dollars one, if you pay less than $50 will be fair

My twin sister bought these for me, and initially I thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable. 

Breaking them in wasn't so hard - although the little 'ball' part made the top of my foot hurt at first. 

But now, they feel stable, comfortable and easy to walk it. They feel perfectly balanced and I've never experiance blisters in these shoes. 

Two thumbs up

I really liked my tote bag.  What I liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that I use mine to tote my books in college.  The only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping.  Let me tell you when I say the company sent the bag "stuffed" in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship.  That was foul!  Despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and I guess I shouldnt complain as much

I am happy with this bag (I got the pink and white one). It is a lovely color, nice size, durable and good price. It comes with an outside pocket and I received it quickly. My only complaint is that almost $7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $3.99, otherwise I highly recommend this bag.

I have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me.  Once again LifeStride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes.  It fits me very well, looks great, and is comfortable.  The color, Wild Rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown. I do recommend the shoe, and of course it is available in other widths-so it is not just for wide feet

Look what I found?  Where?  Under  there!  Under wear? ... Right there! It says, "Be the first person to write a review"  for Jockey Boxer Briefs.  Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?  

Ok, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item.

I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background!

These hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off. 

Finally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a "ten tippy toes" rating for how well they performed in the test.

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes.  It's light weight and flexilble, but still supportive. Well worth $30.

After having purchased the DLO sports case for my Creative Zen Vision M, I read horror story after horror story about the case being too tight, scratching the unit, and even leaving a sticky residue on your valuable player. I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so. 

The case is snug enough so your Zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this. 

The film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end. Fortunately, these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it. And all of this for under $10??? A great deal on an excellent product. Highly recommended

Not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that.  I am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks, nike etc, I decided to try the Crocs and have not gone back !!! Its like walking with slippers on. I have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day. By that night my feet and back were hurting so bad I didnt want to do much but sit down. Right then and there I made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again !!!  I do wish they were a little cheaper so I could add all the colors to my wardrobe. Buy them you wont be sorry !! Stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !

I purchased this tuxedo outfit w/vest for my son who was in his aunt's wedding.  He was 18mos. at the time.  It looked wonderful on him and fit nicely.  The pants were a little long but other than that it fit very nicely on him.  The tuxedo was true to size of my child.  Fast shipping from retailer as well.  I was very impressed overall

I just purchased Fleece Hoodies and pants by Andrew Christian, the material is wonderful.  The hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin.  I would recommend them highly.

The pansts are low-rise, since I am older, I am still getting used to that, but they too feel really good on.

These Wellies (rubber boots) are a show-stopper! I get lots of comments on how smashing they look - and they are very functional - I wear them in the garden, on the beach (can walk into pretty high water without getting wet) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking.

Very happy with them and the price was right too

I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small "note book" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product

I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off

Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice

I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size.

I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!

Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 

Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......

These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.

I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days.

The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired.  While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand

The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.  Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck, they don't return or accept any items back.  So BEWARE, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before).  Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style.  I will not shop here again!  I repeat, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN.  THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER

I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size.

the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company

If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt. 

The t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through

I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off

I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!

Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 

Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......

These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.

Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice

I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.

Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin. 

Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.

But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised??

I purchased these about 3 months ago.  They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere.  I have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home.  They are already ripping in the back.  
I wouldn't recommend them; however, I do get many compliments about how cute they are.

I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.  I would not buy from this company again

I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy

The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive. The elastic and threads bite into your skin. If you use this one for sports, you will constantly be distracted. The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin, esp at the waist

I really really didnt like this product at all. I hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying, very hard to keep them tied. Also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off. The product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all

I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.  But when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too small!  I should have gotten a large.  The medium made me look like I had these big love handles.  So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles

Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month

This "pillow" is an inflated "U" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it.

Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for.

Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige and earthtones you will like these shoes

Our company ordered these shirts from the Texas Shirt Company. While we were happy with the quality, our order was missing 2 shirts. Over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know, but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for - as if to say we were not telling the truth. If you don't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good - but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company

I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.  After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this

The product is great

These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes.  The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact.  I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.

They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them.  I returned them and plan to try something else

I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase. So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings. I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn. I now know why I pay $15.00 for two pair of

The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear

I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it.  The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top.  The straps are too wide.  The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.  

I sent the gown back 3 weeks ago, now, and have STILL not received a refund.  I am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product

Quality was terrible, undersized or seconds. Later I saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1/3 of this price.

I would not recommend these to anyone
I paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit. Amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere. It is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface. I am disgusted with this product

...the shoes weren't quite what I thought they would be, although for 40 bucks I probably shouldn't have been expecting the highest quality pump. They looked a bit cheap, and on top of it all, they were too small for me. There was no return slip in the package, no number to call, no way to send the shoes back to make a return, so now I'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into--and they're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening. My fault for buying shoes at a place called "Hollywood Heelz," I should have known better.
I will say this though, I like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion. If I could fit them, I'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone

The material's good, but the suit runs way too small.  I ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements, but all my wobbly bits are poking out.  I don't think I could wear this out in public!  Not for curvy women!

I bought these because they cost less than Uggs. But there is no comparison. My old Uggs ruled, were totally comfy and warm. I bought these because I didn't have the money for Uggs and they said they were "sheepskin". When I recieved them they looked and felt different. The fur was not "curly and fluffy" like the Uggs, it was relatively short and not as soft. I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. But after several calls the owner told me " they are not 100% sheepskin, they are blended with merino wool" which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website. Also I am a designer/ decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they're synthetic. I returned them, at my cost, and am waiting for a refund. You get what you pay for! I probably could have bought a better pair at Payless.
What happened next: They promised me they would refund my money if I returned the boots at my cost, instead they sent them back to me with no refund. Nice

I just found out that this shirt back-ordered after I was promised by Amazon BEFORE I ordered it that I will receive this item before December 23. I just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th, and I had purchased it on the 15th. This means I will not get it until after December 26th!

Because I bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister, I was only able to give her pants without the shirt for Christmas. She had to leave back across country, and I am forced to send this shirt to her. How embarressing! Obviously it is Christmas time and if you're going to have a storefront on Amazon.com, you better get extra stock! The worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on Christmas and ruining a family member's present. Beware folks, you may not get this item when it says you will

These shoes were very cute, as I thought they would be from the pictures.  But because of the sides being so short, they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking, especially when going up stairs.  I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day..

These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India.  The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be.  I have worn this same style of Bostonian (Marco) for several years, and was completely satisfied.  This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great, comfortable, well-constructed shoe.  Return to having them made in Italy!

The photo is quite deceiving.  This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap, shiny, and is horrible to the touch.  My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness.  Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit

I just received this item and now I have to figure out how to return it. This clock is a piece of trash.  I never could set it correctly. Each time  I set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode. The setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed.  Even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set.
If you buy this clock you will regret it

The other reviewer is spot on. These are pretty (but not truly mirrored) and they broke after only 4 weeks use.  I bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price.  Definitely not worth the $16

They're pretty, but flimsy.  Very light construction.  The lens is not really mirrored, so if you attempting to hide your eyes, forget it.  It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off.  Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking, but cheap--and they feel that way on your face.

I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly, and the underwear is, for some unfathomable reason, heavily perfumed! I had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. Plus, some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight, and some was so loose I couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. Very inconsistent quality. I do not recommend these anymore

Bought one for my new ipod nano, a total disappointment. Very poorly made. Only glued together not stiched up,It already started to go apart. You won't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small.  Plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one's self when walking or working out.  It looks pretty but that is all

the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience

The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks "made in China" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much "classier" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the "string of bubbles" panty

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

I saw the reviews and ordered the bag, the first impression was it looked pretty good! I was happy, if I had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars. The problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front. I had to trim to remove the hanging threads. There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. 

don't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back. It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! 

The next time, I'm going to branded bags, it is worth the price I guess.

On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above).

if u r lucky, u could have got a better bag

I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell. I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price. I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem. I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink. I'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don't make my other clothes smell, and I'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them.

Even for only $12, these weren't worth the money.  They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine, or some other noxious chemical and now, at least 2 months since I have received them, the smell has not dissipated.  They are extremely stiff, so even if they didn't reek, I still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day.  I guess that's what I get for buying cheap shoes

The main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap.  I bought
it for my wife to carry "all that stuff" to work.  With out the strap it does not work.  I requested another one, got it, no strap.  On the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was, if any thing, over done.

     Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.
     Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost and hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.
     I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!  I you choose to, please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order

I bought this for me, but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight.  I have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner.  The shirts are not by any means high or even good quality

I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again...

I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].  I have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small, and the workmanship is questionable, which translates into...that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas.

I would not recommend these hats. You definately get what you pay for. The sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed (even for a 6.00 hat.) I basically threw it out. The sad thing is, I spent as much in shipping as I did on the product

The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back.
Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa.
Thanks.

Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side

There's a fine line between tacky and hip, and these slippers are not it.  These slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person.  Also, the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber-y fabric.  They're not made for warmth.  All around disappointing

I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for "breaking in" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be "broken"

THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THINGS i HAVE EVER BOUGHT. SERVES ME RIGHT FOR BY A SANDAL WITHOUT EVER HAVING TRIED IT ON. I WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE WITH THEM AND BARELY MADE IT HOME THEY HURT THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET SO BADLY I MAY NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OFF OF WORK. THE PART OF THE SANDAL WHERE IT MIGHT NORMALLY BE FLAT AND CUSHIONED HAS SHARPENED PLASTIC SPIKES KNIFING THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT RIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY OF EVER HAVING WORN THESE SO CALLED SANDALS. AND I LOVE ADIDAS

These boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that I wore them out, although each boot split along the outside, toe sole after approximately 10 wears. These splits, although tiny, allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant West Coast puddles. I still wear them, but now only for fashion instead of function

The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit.

This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining. The people who like it must be quite thin, indeed. 

It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn't breathe very well, either. 

I am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices, though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me. 

For the price, you can do better, even at someplace like Target

Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product.

These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.

I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it

I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard

I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks.  I discontinued using them because i started wearing  different styles than the crew/white/standard. Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes. perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management. in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic, making them basically worthless. yippee

When I ordered this skort the description didn't say that it was a childs size.  So I complained to the site that I bought it from.  I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn't specify that this was a childs size.  I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn't have ordered if I had known it wasn't an adult sized item.  They didn't return my shipping

I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop

I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable. You also do not notice anything "irregular".

However, I ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house. Not a good plan. These are very thin, plus the fly is very narrow. All in all, not very useful for my intended purpose

Save your money. Its worth a buck, if that. I cant believe they have the nerve to sell it and not expect complaints for this garbage. Shipping is a complete rip off, and I will never order from this company again

Item was called "Fleese" but was 80% cotton and looked and felt like a regular sweat shirt. To return an item to them, they give you free mailing, but they will deduct $5.95 off the refund for SandH. After calling them about this, they agreed to give us a full refund. But the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles. I doubt that makes many consumers happy. Champion makes a fine line of products, but I will never deal with them on line agai

These compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind I have.  Aside from the low grade material and poor stiching, the waist band rides up around my chest!  It looks like they were designed for someone 7 feet tall

I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy. ( if that is the case, why are prices slashed by 50%...it is because people do not want to pay the full price ...)I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica. A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company

I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg.

I love the t-shirt because I loved the movie, but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms, this may present an issue for you.  The areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit

I bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it.  The quality is poor.  The wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way.  Also, the wallet actually looked fake (not sure if it is) because the XOXO is upside down.  You cannot tell from looking at the picture.

This was my first online shoe order.  I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on.  I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12.  While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.

These shoes were incredibly tight.  They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted.  They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in.

The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back.  I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes.  It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great

I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals.  The Betula sandals are clearly inferior.  A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into.

With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.  Plus, the cut (of the size 12 at least) was awkward, giving my tummy a bubble that wasn't even there.   And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is.  So I don't recommed this item

I liked the boots in the first couple of weeks-they are very warm and comfy, however they are not at all durable -after a month of use the soles had holes. My freind who had them experienced the same problem. 
They are great feet warmers when the weather is dry, but they are not waterproof.

I used to wear lame-ass Y-fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping. I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies. So I did, and gladly! There's no way I could go back to this 'maxi' sh*t anymore. I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE!! I'm talking fat-guy big. You don't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff. So here's my advice: if you're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller. You'll be happy you did

Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it and email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls

This is a nice looking wallet, but the internal design leaves something to be desired.

There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards.  I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome.

The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards.

There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)

The fabric, texture and color were extremely cheap quality.  It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund. Don't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes.

I ordered a 7.5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe.  I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  I can tell you that it was way too narrow.  I don't know about the length because my foot wouldn't go in.  I had to return them.  I wouldn't buy another pair of Daniel Green's until I knew for sure how the sizes really run.  0 Stars

Ordered a pair...and they lost my first order.  Had to contact amazon to help. Finally got order..and pants were too small. So..had to RE order larger size.  Got pants in SAME size as last. Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small.    
First they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back. Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables.  Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..NO REPLY.  Never had such POOR customer service

Company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt.  I ordered 3 different shirts.  This shirt is large in size but very short!  Not what I had expected.  Asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were Christmas gifts for my daughter.  I received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem.

I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful.

I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, "hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy. 
They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet.

I'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received, but the case I received doesn't cut it for the 60GB. It fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them. I do NOT recommend this product for the 60GB. I suppose we Zen 60GB owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players

For slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test. The small lip in the back does more harm than good.I ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough. If you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere. The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable

I placed order on 10/10. I called Blue Blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10/16 that my order had not been shipped. I that it would be shipped that day. I was told that I may get my item 10/23 or 10/ 24. Horrible customer service. The shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long, but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item. I will not order from Blue Blood Racing again!!

Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away

These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply

For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K. Rowling should be upset that English Woolens, with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know, will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people

The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.

These are supposed to 3x boxers, that means they should be made for a big man.  Well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers. they were about 2 inches long. They were horrible for him.  He threw 2 of them out.  
My advice: DONT GET THESE FOR A BIG, TAL MAN THEY'LL MMAKE U FEEL LIKE A GIANT

These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).  

I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot

I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.  

I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick

I have a pair if clogs from Europe that I wear in the operating room.  I need to replace them.  They are European size 50.  So what's the deal?  You don't make your shoes in Men's sizes.  You think we all have girley feet?  Get with it, clowns.  Real men occasionally wear clogs too.  You can't make a size 16

I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work.

It clearly states for the shell material 100% nylon. The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket. The jacket is completely polyester. The tag says Shell: 100% polyester and Lining: 100% polyester. Returning it would be pointless. I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information

The sizing on this cardigan is way off.  I ordered a women's medium and it looks like a child size large.  The sleeves are about 4" too short and the overall profile is far too small.  To make matters worse, I ordered it as a X-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I'm stuck with a bad product

Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again.

For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic "torpedo" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable.

We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you

I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!

sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe.  this case is a classic - you get what you pay for.  cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.  

1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe.
2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick.
3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe.  feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST.  3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute.  this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.  

this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair

While they are certainly bold and noticeable -- and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information -- they aren't even close to being "leather." I don't think I would have bought them if I saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand.  Not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller

I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking

:( these will give you pain. I bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture, and considering they weren't just a $5 pair of shoes, i thought they would be somewhat comfortable, if not doable, to wear.  BUYER BEWARE:  these shoes will cut your heels.  they run a little small, so i suggest getting at least a half size larger.  if you want to do anything BESIDES sitting and looking pretty, DO NOT buy these shoes. I walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels.  they also are a little tight on the toes, so if you have a wide foot, these definitely are not for you. i have to admit, they are darling and cute, but they are NOT WORTH THE PAIN.

accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side.  all my other zippered garments come that way.  this turfer men's endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward.  would not buy again for that reason. 

this shell is otherwise nicely made

One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...  

One more thing, only the screen is protected by a clear plastic. The wheel is not

I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally.

I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies.

I bought two of these, hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event, and quickly returned them.   Since it took over two weeks for delivery, I am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return/refund.  The sashes are not the quality that I thought was represented by the term "charmeuse", and are thin and gauzy.   They came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz, much of that must have been the packaging.  A quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction

I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).

At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.

Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere

The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area. 

There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection.

The product would have been great, but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes. I requested XL Long pants. They sent size 3X pants. So they are completely unusable, and do not respond to my emails. I would never order from them again

This bra was well made, fabric very soft but the sizes were way off. Cup is cut to big, it would be difficult to wear a scoop, or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area. Would not buy this brand again or style again, even for $7 each

I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra's here and both of them broke within one week.  I have never had such a negative experience with a product before.  Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment and they broke right away. Since I don't know how to get my money back or an adjustment, this cost me approx $60 for a loser of a purchase. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this one

I never wanted to write one of these, but I feel I have to. I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price. This is something that any dime store would do, but apparently one of the world's largest online retailers couldn't. This is very disappointing, and I would never recomend this company to anyone....ever....quite the opposite

I bought this watch from REI.  The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC.  On the second two the plastic housing started separating.  That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back.

Also, it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading.  Too bad, the watch sounded so good..

Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop. I received with battery problems, it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it. You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner. The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all

Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me

"Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading

Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed. 

Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product

I have a 33-34 waste. I bought the medium size because it is  advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste. The thing is too tight! It almost blocks circulation to my legs. Plus, the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch. I was mostly disappointed with this product. You can find a much better value at this price

I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and "A" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are "painfully small" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight.
By the way, I laundered them in cold water, just like I do all my clothing

"Sling" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think "tourniquet" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the "sling" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more RandD before it's ready for the Big time

The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. If these briefs enhance a man's "profile" at all, it's because they're so darn tight; it has nothing to do with the Sling Support. And talk about "low-rise"--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dryer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore. My advice: anybody ordering C-IN² briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear

I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.

I ordered this product for a friend's bday since I got these same boots and loved them.  I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them.  Except it NEVER happened.  I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago, I call amazon and they tell me to call macys.  I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon.  I've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail.  Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order.  Although now i've told my friend she's getting these boots and now she's not.  I've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ Aerosoles.  I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again.  WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now

This is a very styling money clip, however, it is not like a big paper clip. It opens like a butterfly, then closes together with the strenght of the magnets. It feels that your money and other cards might fall off. I'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information

The shoes look and wear great.  However, the leather is pretty weak.  I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them.  Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it.  I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it.  Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all

"Classic" sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking, (and now "spinning"?)  I hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans, leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor. Dangerous for working out, and certainly not "classic!"

Even though I bought these for $9.99 I still somewhat regret it. The quality of the jacket is "really" poor. Every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed-- from the pockets to the zippers. While wearing it, the jacket smells like "paint" or what they used to bleach the colors on. I hope the smell gets out after washing. I am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when I wash it and onto my other clothes

I am a bit disappointed in the quality.    It looked like a possible reject off the factory line.  There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets.
You really should not expect too much.  You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain.

IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER, THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL. THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE. THE VELCRO ISN'T QUITE RIGHT EITHER. THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH, BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED...WASN'T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE.

I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - I loved the cotton, one-hand closures, and the lack of underwires.  It felt and looked great when I tried it on, but after a few hours of wearing, it had the classic problem of riding up in the back.  Eventually I gave up wearing it at all.  I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put.

This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund

I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However,
when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been 
$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too.
Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.

It's true that you get what you pay for. The good thing I can say about 
this product is that the price is right. But the quality was low and the fit
was poor. HOwever, if you are strapped for money then they are certainly
wearable. But get a half size smaller than you usually would get

This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen, although the image might look good in here. My size is usually between medium and large, I ordered size medium. However, when I received and tried it on, I end up look like wearing XXX-large jacket. Also, the craftmanship is very poor, the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing. I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee. Nevertheless, I returned it yesterday. Please don't waist your money on this order, it's not worth it at all.

The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase

Can you say P A I N? This is what Steve Madden shoes are. Pain.
The soles must be made of cast iron. The upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough. I am convinced that this Madden person HATES WOMEN. If it were in my power, I would track down Steve Madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs, Only Standing, Walking and .....Dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain.

I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market.

Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card, I would not recommend this product

I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt. It looked all right when she opened the package, but when she wore it, it made the kid look as if she had flub.  It was inexpensive enough that I won't bother returning it, but the item, although well made, was sized so small as to be useles

In my previous review, very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a "disappointment"!  Very cheap looking, there were some visible defects (noticed right away), too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn. Tribeca's are my favorite KC shoes but again, if you wear a 9, go a size up for a better fit and comfortability.  

Good luck, shoe shoppers

WARNING!!! Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight!  You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem. Sadly, it's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk. [...

You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that.

I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available.  As far as appearance, it is well crafted.  When it comes to functinality, it stinks.  Here are the problems I have with it:  1) there is no hole for the microphone,  2) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly, 3) the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement.  This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make.  This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player

I wore the boots one time and it will be the only time. The boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable. The material is so hard and did not give. I even wore socks and that did not help. I would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort

I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry

I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts.  I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.).  After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly.  It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included).  Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this.

Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen and the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball. They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way

This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well.

I was so disappointed in this product.  I bought the ad hook, line, and sinker, thinking that the memory foam was a great idea, that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief.  After about 2 hrs of wear, the foam is completely flat, which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  These are awful

While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival, it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency.  It can hook to the IPOD, cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD, but it does not transmit.  The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return.  While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller, it is not worth my effort.

All in all -- a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product

They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me

Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only.  Supplier does not carry the wide ones.  Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths.  Not here.  No exchange possible.  Now I'm stuck with shoes that don't fit and midwest sports couldn't care less. I won't ever order from them again

Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet.

Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only.

Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well. 

Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back.

I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance, thickness, etc. However, it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes, the heels, and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places. My 8 month olds' socks are fine, however, he doesn't give them the wear of a three year old. So if you have a baby, these socks are great! If you have a preschooler, very poor choice

Turn around time to receive item was good.  Material of the shirt was sub-par (very thin) for the price.

These jeans were so very disappointing.  After hearing about PDC many times, I was excited to own a pair.  But these jeans were made of cheap, uncomfortable fabric and the style just doesn't work.  I won't be buying PDC again

My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different.  At 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6-9 mo PJs.  I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear.  Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on

In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big "shoe collector" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose

Good features include many pockets.

Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining. As a result, the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks.

Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets.

I thought this case would be like the ipod cases I have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod; it is not.  The case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage.  The belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand doesn't work well.  Overall I would not recomend this product

I bought this as a surprise for my wife.  When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that "you get what you pay for," but this was a piece of garbage.

This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever.  The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all.  This will fit like a potato sack, folks.  I notice that the "raw edges" are now listed as a "feature."  Ahem.

In a recent e-mail exchange with them, I was told that (their words now): "quality is a subjective issue."  They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback, and I would absolutely recant them.

In their defense: my money has now been refunded.

Now... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it, worn for 90 seconds?  It would have been off sooner, but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head.

Wish I could rate as a "zero

Save yourself the trouble and get the BRAIDED (3-line) latex hose type of clothesline. Want suction cups / rings / snap hooks, etc? Buy them for pennies at a drug store. The problem with this clothesline is that you can't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines--they slide down to the lowest point in the middle. The only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they'll dry is with a braided line, period.

I was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice "just because" gift. When I opened the package I was really disappointed. The color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together. 
Now I have to return the item because it just looks bad. The problem with returning is the non-refundable $7.50 to ship to me and the $5.95 I have to pay to ship it back to them. 

I also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who couldn't find my order.

Shouldn't Amazon address this in some way? If it is real I would buy it; if it is fake (and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score) shouldn't this be off Amazon's site? I think it becomes an issue of Amazon's credibility..

I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit.
I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique.
The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic

We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive

This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod. Real scam

The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge.  It was more like a tent than a bathrobe.  It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18.  I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)

The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP!

I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company

The cheaper variety at Walmart ($8.92 versus $19 and up), No Boundaries brand, is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm, more like a Birkenstock cork sole which I also find very comfortable, for me anyway. They do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way.
Walmart also has a real color explosion going on. You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.

So, for the cheaper price Walmart offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there. If you are looking for a firm Birkestock type sole, the No Boundaries brand Croc is a shoe-in, no pun intended.

The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received.
They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects.
I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them

Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.

Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...

I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking. 
It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking.

After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour, the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle.  Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked.  Midwest wont take them back since i wore them.

Hey! I'm twelve years old and I just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these. They feel really nice on the skin and they don't bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer-briefs do. They also give really good support to your penis. They keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort. Boys, ya'll all seriously need to try these undies out. They're awesome

i too have been searching for the panty in the picture.
i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg.  there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric, but there is more like 3 inches...yuk!  ; b
has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured?  (the ones that we all seem to love and want)?
please email me personally if u have found them!

Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again

My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return

The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered. However, the item that is described and that I received (Halfpant), is NOT what is pictured. What is pictured is a hi-cut pant. I did not realize this until I received the order, and was greatly disappointed. I had to send everything back. You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item. I actually would give this 0 stars, but the computer would not allow that.

This was a poorly made product.  Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW.  Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find.  I ended up returning this for a full refund

Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.

I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing

I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe.  To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product.  This is more of an insert to a wallet, consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket.  I wasn't pleased with the purchased, expecting quite a bit more the $14 I spent.  I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe

These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine. They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton, and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs.  If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product

I've purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here. Though I was suspicious, I ordered one anyway. Not surprisingly, the cups puckered when I tried it on. Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC. When I inquired about returning it, I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy (though not posted anywhere I could find easily). 

I believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact.

I will not purchase from this company again, and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general

I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!

I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS. I wish I had a 8 year old son, because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now

Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. 

Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. 

The directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.

For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.

There must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.

Not happy

Have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems. This time was different. They sent the wrong shorts. I paid the shipping to send them back. I asked, please send the right shorts. They credited my account an amount smaller than I paid. And that was that. Certainly not satisfied.

I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased.  This item never arrived from Macy's.  I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days.  3 weeks later I still didnt have the item.  I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available.  My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item

I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size. 

When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing. 

That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair

A beautiful checkbook cover that even has a pen holder. But the problem is when I put the checks in (regular sized) the cover will not lay flat. Perhaps it will after awhile but I've never had a checkbook cover do this before. I can't recommend this item

The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warm

thats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs.

i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo, but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front. The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy, and the ties up the back looked awful. It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine, but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it

   This was my second time ordering a Dickies jacket and being disappointed, I will not do it again. The zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime I zip or unzip it.
   I contacted Andrew Christian over ninety days ago by e-mail and I was ignored. Today I decided to send him a message through Amazon and found out it was to late. I thought that the time limit was 180 days.
   I like everything else about the jacket, but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration, there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there

Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps

The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time

I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.

The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.

If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO

I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..

TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.

This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...

I truly  beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...

Thanks, hope this helped...

I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.

Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened.

They are horrid to wear, I oredered a medium size and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL.

DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley.

You've got to be con artist to sell these things

The shawl is very thin, not good quality, I suspect it is not cashmere at all, but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools. The color was supposed to be expresso, not even that promise was fulfilled, it is a much lighter brown. I do not recommend this shawl at all

These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.

I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size.  I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes.  Order wisely

Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.

At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box.
But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe.

Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement. (I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A., who brought it back to Singapore for me

The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time

I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic

I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern

These were a waste of money.  They were not properly designed to cover ANYTHING, much less my backside, even though I did order what SHOULD have been the right size.  I realize I have a lot to cover, but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick.  I've still got a pair in white that I haven't even opened!  And won't!  It would be a waste of energy!

After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.

I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars.

I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Sport Knit Pants. I had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere

I bought 5 pairs, had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths.  The 4 remaining were much too long--the ends of the pants were under my heels.  I knew they'd shrink, but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low, they barely reach my ankle bone.  I like my pants longer than that. And they've faded to navy blue, even though I used Woolite for dark laundry.  Nothing else has faded as much as these pants.

Also, they're lighter weight than they used to be.  I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England, and they were warm enough for just about anything.  Now the wind whistles through them.

Sorry, Land's End; I'll try LL Bean next time

I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?

Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!
Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  

It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...

That's not all the changes.....

They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.

The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....

The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.

They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.

Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.

Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.

Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.

I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a "specialist" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.

I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.

BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN"T.

IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE "OLD" VERSION.

SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO "FIX" THEM????

I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.

I bought this shirt last yr for my husband. It lasted about 6 months. Much pilling (those horrid dots all over the fabric),and seams coming un-done. After about 3 washings, it looked like I had bought it at Goodwill, used. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating. Plus, you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company FOREVER. Their advertisments/photos cater to gay men.Get ready to see some very unusual attire.
Not that there is anything wrong with that. ( Loved that Seinfeld episode

The slipper seems to have some craftmenship. In my case they seem to run about a half size small. Who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch? I wish I had known this in advance ... they look good in my closet though

I ordered both the cherry and black Deer Stags through Sportman's guide.com. When I recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking. The black pair was dull and had no shine. Instead of returning the product,as should have done, I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes.
All attempts failed. Very unhappy with product. I have learned
my lesson

Save your money and lock your luggage with cheap lock ties.  Our TSA lock was cut the very first time we used it.  Turns out the ENTIRE terminal has only 1 set of key so screener just don't bother /have the time to unlock this approved lock.

I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon, and was very disappointed and returned them.  I normally wear size 10M from Adidas, as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs.  Yet with these shoes, size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL, and quite painful.  They were returned...  If you order them, make sure you get a larger/wider size

I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on. I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in

Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one

I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a "freebie" and too small for much use anyway.

Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn

The shirt was beautiful.  Notice I used the past tense verb "was"?  After hand washing it twice the hem came out, the front tie fell off, and the side of the lace ripped open.  It found a new home in the trash.

I've ordered from this seller before and the dress I recieved from the previously was perfect. While delivered promptly, this dress was not as it was pictured.

The bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill-fitting. unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it, it's basically too unflattering to wear.

I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products.

This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though.

I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material. The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.

I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. 

While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort. Also, you can have real Birks "repaired" so they never really wear out.

**Black version has large "Betula" on side in white

Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money.

I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them

I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper

I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not "wick away moisture."  The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors.

I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable
and because they looked like they were made of leather.
They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not
attractive.  They will be returned.

First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear

I guess you get what you pay for. the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item. It reminded me more of what I would find in my cat's litter box than a magical device

In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit). The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn't even allow my feet half way in. I wish they fit because they look good, the quality is good, and price unbeatable. However, I lost $8.50 at the UPS when I sent them back

I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition

Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks.
It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing.
Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem.
The service was excellent from Belt Outlet.
Arrived in a normal amount of time.. Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning

The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated.  I have two problems with the scarf:
     1.  I thought "sheer" meant sheer.
     2.  I expected the edges to be finished (hemmed)

I purchased this scarf as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law.  It was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope.  I had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store.  I would have been embarrassed to give her the Pashmina scarf.  It was a wasted of money

The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.

Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.

A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.

I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph

These booties are very cute and soft, but they just slip right off my son's feet.  They do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet, the 'tongue' part just pulls right out.  Not a good value for the money.

Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them

I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement. 
BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  

*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks.

Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned

These are made of a nice material and good for travelling.  However, the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing.  As soon as I sit, nothing is really being covered.

With a longer inseam, these would be awesome

I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed, the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen, and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap.  I returned them, and I will avoid buying this brand agai

Sizes run small. Zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment. I should have spent a couple bucks more and got Dickies or another brand

I've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues.  About 9 months ago, Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer.  These t-shirts are nothing but crap now!  They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be, and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads.  The price hasn't gone down.. just the quality.  Please don't get ripped off... do NOT buy these shirts.  Here is another case of American immorality at it's best.  Let's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours

At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.

I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.

As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.

After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.

With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.

Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper.

I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time.  The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching.  Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them!  I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings.  Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.  However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product.  I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck.  I will only pay sale prices

saw these on sale at Macys, on the rack, no box. figured why not, they felt good. But when I tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard. she said I looked like penguin butt and I have a waddle.  I'm going back to other boxer briefs. Personally I didn't find them comfortable at all, and I like this style, AandF, DKNY, CK, other jockey....i'll stick to those..

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.

As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating

Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.  I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.  I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22

I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked!
Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined.
I DON'T RECOMMEND IT

These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize.

I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. 

Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.

Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.

If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat

I wish there were 0 star. Although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them.
After searching a lot for buying a present for my sister's birthday, I found this sandal and I decided to buy. I ordered it on March 9th and after 20 days !! , still I haven't received them !!!!!! I am getting my money back. 
Not only I have wasted my time but also I should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late!!!!
Conclusion: These sandals are very beautiful but NEVER fall for them.

I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening!  I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me.  I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool.  But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune "pig skin" leather.  When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag.  The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell.  It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen!  I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200!  I love Amazon and everything they have to offer!  They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore.  Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step!  I know I was!!!
