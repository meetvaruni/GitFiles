I love this phone. And I'm not an Apple fanboy, I've owned Androids and I've owned feature phones. Each have their pros and cons. Here's my list of likes and dislikes:

Like:
Reliable. I can count on this phone to not crash, restart, or otherwise fail. I turn it off once every few days, just so it gets reset every so often. I've never HAD to, though. It runs fluidly and smoothly, as intended. My Android didn't fare as well, with crashes and restarts as much as twice a day.

Fast. Apps load and switch seamlessly. Camera loads in a second, so I can snap that shot before it passes.

Battery. It literally lasts about 2 days with moderate use, if I didn't play on it so much I wouldn't doubt it'd last 3 days. It's fantastic to not worry about power management or if I have my charger with me.

Camera: Shutter speed is fast, flash is bright, shots are clear and crisp. Video is 720p. Very nice!

Apps: An app for every occasion. I have games, a news app, flashlight, social networking, skype, GPS, etc. It's awesome.

iOS: It's great. The new notification pull-down is so convenient. It basically copied the Android version (for once!) and it executed it well.

Dislikes:
Not much. Not as open as Android. Jailbreaking helps.

No notification light. It would be nice to have an LED to let you know when you have a notification.

No 4G. It's becoming more and more mainstream, but when this phone came out only Sprint had 4G so it's not too big a deal.

I would HIGHLY recommend this phone, or the 4S, which is basically the same with a little better processor and camera, and Siri. It never fails to disappoint me.
