This is a decent moisturizer, but honestly it isn't much different than the other top moisturizers on the market. It does its job well, and can be used over the entire body. HOWEVER, it is NOT a non-comedogenic product (in other words, it can cause acne). I used it on my face, and had small break-outs after just two days. So if you have acne-prone skin, definitely don't use this.

It does have a "different" smell to it - I don't find it as offensive as others do, but it definitely isn't an overly pleasant smell. I recommend smelling it before buying it to see if it is something that bothers you.

Bottom line - decent moisture but nothing special, unique smell, and not for acne-prone skin.
