I'm actually a bigger fan of the Nivea Creme Nivea Creme, 6.8 Oz (192 G), (Pack Of 3) (which comes in a blue 6.8 oz jar). If you're wondering about the difference between the two, the Nivea creme is much much thicker and much better suited for severely dry (i.e. as dry as it can get before you start need a prescription), whereas the Nivea Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil & Vitamin E, 6.8 Ounces(in the white tubs) is good for mild-to-moderately dry skin. I keep both in my medicine cabinet and use them both constantly. I prefer the smell of the "white" Nivea over the "blue" Nivea, though the blue one is nice too. The Nivea Refreshingly Soft Creme absorbs very quickly as well, which is a plus.
