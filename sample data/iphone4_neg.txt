TERRIBLE SERVICE! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY! I recieved what I thought was a new apple iphone in the mail. It was registered as someone else's name and broke after two days. I took this product to Apple and they told me they could not fix the phone because it was a FAKE iphone, not one of the internal or external pieces were made by apple. I contacted the seller and once I exposed there sale of fraudulent phones, they denied my right of return and/or reimbursement.
