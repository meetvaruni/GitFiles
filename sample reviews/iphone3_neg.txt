Upon activation, I discovered this phone, purchased as "NEW" -- had actually been used and in service for 18 months, according to serial number verification by Verizon. The owner of Top Shelf Electronics emailed me the following response:

"Some of these devices have been activated before but remained in new condition. It does not mean the phone was used. It is impossible to get any never unactivated iPhone 4 for Verizon anywhere but Verizon itself."

Please be aware that this vendor is selling used items as NEW
