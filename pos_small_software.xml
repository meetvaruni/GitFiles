I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it

I concur with the review that points up the problems with Adobe's new "license manager" method of activation. When you pay as much as you do for this app, or the entire suite, you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems, or can't connect to the Internet from "location shooting." I took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic.

That said, this version of Photoshop is superb, an otherwise 5-star app. If you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help (used to be separate folders, with chapters 1 - 4 of the Classroom In A Book, but no more alas), or get one of Deke McClelland's fine tomes and do all the lessons, there is nothing in this app that the novice can't start to use from Day One. With today's point and shoot cameras packing more resolution, and more manual control, into their functions, use of Photoshop becomes more than just a hobby. You can really "rescue" photos that are too dark, too bright, exceedingly color-shifted, from the "cut" folder and still make prints. Further, the Camera RAW functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography.

A warning: you need the fastest processor you can afford (a Core Duo or Quatro will be superb), and as much RAM as your system can take. There is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM. You need AT LEAST that much under Windows XP to get good performance out of PS CS2. If you can use 2GB or more dual-channel memory, that's even better (the dual-channel RAM adds a small boost when handling large file sizes, e.g. Camera RAW image sources). If you don't have these, don't expect Photoshop to act fast. 

Adobe Bridge is a major improvement for this version. It offers superior file and image management functions, and can even do batch editing on images. You can even perform Camera RAW adjustments right from Bridge. Bridge can perform batch processes WHILE YOU EDIT IN PHOTOSHOP. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. If you doubt me, check out Deke McClelland's PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE tutorial for his chapter on using Adobe Bridge. His video introduction (included on a DVD in the book), and chapter on using and customizing Bridge, are terrific introductions.

If you're a user of versions 5.x (as I was), 6, or 7, upgrading to CS2 is a no-brainer. Don't wait. Get it now before the Adobe License Manager gets worse in 2007

Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve

I was afraid at first not to order directly from Adobe but decided to take the cheaper route. It was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up, original CD set, etc.
Shipped in record time as well.

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice and ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. 

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! 

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text and paragraph and fill and stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. 

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. 

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. 

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.

If you're one of those people like me, who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time, now is the time to upgrade.  You won't be disappointed.  Just ask the editors of both PC Magazine and C|Net which awarded this version their Editor's Choice Award.

Once again Adobe has listened to its loyal customer base.  The proof is in the new version of Illustrator.  Many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn't even think of.  I was happy to find out that even with the new features, Adobe has not altered Illustrator's previous palettes or keyboard commands.  There's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version.  No fear here!

First of all, I want to say that I am really impressed with the Live Trace and Live Paint features, especially when used together.   We all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer.  We end up drawing it out on a napkin, paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment.  Normally, once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using Illustrator which takes both time and effort---not any more.

Take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in.  Once the image has been scanned, then the fun begins.  Once the image has been scanned in and brought into Illustrator CS2, use the Live Trace feature to actually trace your drawing.  This feature actually turns to drawing into a Live Trace object for easy manipulation.  After applying some blurring as needed, your traced image is cleared up.  Then, convert your Live Trace object into a Live Paint object using the new Control Palette.  I like the Live Paint tool also because it reminds me of working in Photoshop.

Once you've converted to the Live Paint object, you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking.  Live Paint also has a feature called Gap Detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line.  This is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later.  When the object outlines are finalized, use the Live Paint feature to easily fill any region with color.  Voila!  You are done.  Go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes.

A concern of many of us for years was the fact that while Illustrator keep getting better and newer features, it also mean more and more palettes.  Sometimes it became a little unmanageable.  However, the pros at Adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution - the Control palette.  This new palette sits at the top of the screen.  First, it acts as a an object inspector providing information.  Secondly, (and more importantly), the Control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus, brush shape, opacity, and style.  No longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features.  If you are fans of Adobe's other Creative Suite 2 software, you will be pleased to learn that the Control Palette is apart of their new makeover too.

Here are some more new additions and changes to Illustrator:

*	Like Photoshop, Illustrator CS2 now supports custom workspaces.  You can display only the palettes you need at any time. You are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates.
*	Adobe has improved the Swatch and color integration.  Now, working with the other Creative Suite 2 programs is seamless.
*	Isolation Mode is a feature that allows you to double-click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the Layers Palette.
*	CS2 now supports all of the latest Wacom tablets. It now provides brush support for the new Wacom 6D Art Pen and adds a new dimension Illustrator's Calligraphic and Scatter brushes
*	Adobe Bridge integration is now a part of Illustrator CS2.  Bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow.
*	Macromedia Flash exports are now available.  You can export both text and objects as Flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects.
*	You can now open Photoshop files with layer comps within Illustrator.  This new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time, just as you do in Photoshop
*	Custom stroke placement is a new addition to Illustrator. You can now place strokes on the outside, inside or center of a path.
*	Underline and Strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements.
*	These are a few of the new features!

The $169 upgrade cost is well worth the money, just for the Live Trace and Live Paint features alone.  However, you get so much more in the new Illustrator CS2.  Upgrade now and be completely satisfied.  If you haven't purchased a vector graphics program, get Illustrator, especially if you are already an owner of a version of Photoshop.  This new version of Illustrator even looks more like the familiar Photoshop layout.

I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant

I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  

First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?
Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.

Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!

New Features in Acrobat 7
*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.
*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!
*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.
*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.

More About Acrobat
Although many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  

Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.

This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.

In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.

Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  

Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.

For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.
Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.
Summary
I would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.
This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.
Testing Setup
To conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:
PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)
Epson Scanner/Fax/Printer
HP LaserJet 8150DN Printer
For software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:
MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)
Photoshop CS

Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!)

I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.

The bad stuff:

First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.

Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.

Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).

Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. 

Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.

Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.

Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.

Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.

Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.

Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.

Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.

Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.

Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.

Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.

Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:

First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.

Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.

Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.

In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.

There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.

This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose.

It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game.

Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock.

I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it

These are a favorite in the home. Even though we have all of them, they   are each different and provide hours of entertainment. Skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals. Great source of fun and learning. Also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game

I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done

Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.

I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.
I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.

I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.
I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine

This is an easy product to use.  It saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space.  It will grab it from another hard drive.  It is also useful in setting up a D: drive for Documents, and and E: drive for programs.  It is useful to have windows on C: alone.  There are fewer crashes.

The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel

I upgraded from Version 5. I don't use very many of the features. But the big difference I see is, files sizes seem to be greatly reduced. Something I would scan and be 10mb, now might be 2mb. This is just opinion, nothing scientific. The interface takes some getting used to, a bit different. Overall for the price ($99 - Less $20 Rebate), a great deal

I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser.  Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office.  I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6.  There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile.  Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement.  I recommend

and#65279;Sandra; hope you get to read this before giving up on this great little program.
Check your printer drivers and spooler.  I'm as close to a computer guru as you'd want having
played with computers in general and PC's in particular since the heady early days of Sinclair,
Kildall, and Adam Osborne.  Installed Hallmark Card Studio on my beloved's machine several
years back.  Was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner - my
lady took to it immediately - and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user (only wish
could import export data to other address books, and wouldn't it be great to have a Palm
conduit?!-)(I digress!-).
Every new version just gets better to the point 2004 has close to two gigs of cards and imagery.
In short, Sandra Hallmark Card Studio 2004 IS A KEEPER.

Now, approve of your using 98SE, I recommend to my students (yes I teach computing) not to go
beyond 98SE and certainly not to connect anything from MS to the InterNet beyond 98SE (little
thing code name of Palladium!-(
There can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool32.  Try removing your
printer under START and#62;SETTINGS and#62;PRINTERS, restart your computer with the printer on and
reinstall.  Hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program.  HB

This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! 

There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.

I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.

I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past

I have been running Windows XP SP2 and would "never" want to go back to Windows ME or Windows 98. With the XP, I rarely need to re-boot my system, and my PC no longer freezes up. There is a built-in Windows Firewall plus a pop-up blocker which are both awesome. The system is much safer, and I have NEVER had a virus, worm, or trojan horse while running the Windows XP Home with a good internet security/virus program.

One thing: Make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your PC before starting to download, as this does require at least that.

Get it! You won't be disappointed

I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.

An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.

In Response to Linux Users-
Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.

For Mac Users-
Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's

I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.

Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.

I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.

Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars

Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs.

Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.

I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.

This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.

I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).

If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again

I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. 

I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..

Definitely worth the upgrade

Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice

First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.

Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.

You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  

For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.

All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.

You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).

For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem.  As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great.  You do get a variety of photos of objects.  For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries.  For $17 this is definitely worth the money.

I've found it is best to export the image to a graphic editor.  Then from there, make it transparent, resize it, and compress it to your wishes.  There's a fair amount of "People" graphic, but not as much as I'd like.  I don't have the 100K collection so don't know if there's any image overlapse between this and that collection.

Quality is pretty nice for small prints and great for web.  Especially superb for smaller projects like christmas cards and so forth, but not good if you want to print high resolution photographs on large paper.

For $17 this is the best collection I've ever bought, Photo Objects II is still in shipping, so can't compare quality with that collection yet.

OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.
OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.
In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.
Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected

Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics.  Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D. 

Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors, and hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive).  Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed.

Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design

There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.

It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.

I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.

The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system

I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure.

I ordered the box version from Amazon, instead of the download from the manufacturer not only because it was less expensive, but the main reason was so that I would have a paper manual. So many programs don't come with hard copy manuals and I prefer them over on-line help. 

As for the program itself, I trialed a download first. For me, the thing I fell in love with was the ability to call up multiple images, side by side, and compare them! It makes selecting the best image a breeze - a HUGE timesaver. You also have the ability to swiftly zoom in to check focus at full rez. Another wonderful thing is that putting the curser over one of the preview images, and sliding it, will slide all the open previews simultaneously, so you don't have to individually zoom and move each image. You can do this with up to 6 images at a time! You can also do a quick histogram check by hitting the "h" key, which makes it easy to toss off bad exposures at the same time as the review. While you've got the previews open you can hover the mouse over them and hit any # key to color-code the image. The colors can be keyed to whatever description you want. I do "1=green" for yes, "2=yellow" for maybe, and "3=red" for no. There's room for quite a few more colors after that. I then hit the sort key back in the main screen and quickly select all the red "no" images and delete them. After I have all my green "yes" images, I then review them 6 at a time to give them star ratings. I resort by rating and now all the best images are at the top of the page and I can start processing them. 

You can batch process file name, and some other things that I don't bother with, as well. It's got some nice keywording ability and you can easily sync the keywords with your Photoshop files. What's incredibly nice is that you can click on any word in the keyword list and all the images you own, with those keywords, are immediately shown in thumbnails! Finding an image is actually fun! It will even give you thumbnails of images you don't even store on your hard drive anymore! 

Fantastic program - I highly recommend it! The only reason I didn't 5 star it is b/c it's not all that intuitive. This is a read-the-manual kind of program, but you can do an awful lot with it without having to get too far in the book. ;)

I downloaded the demo of this program and although I am by no means a pro photographer I do have over 4,000 digital photographs of my family and I am taking new photos each day. In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos.  I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first

This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. 

The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect

Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.

I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. 

I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.

An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.

Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.

InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.

Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.

As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.

If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.

This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago

I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program

I liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times. I always shoot with Nikon RAW format. It has hung a couple of times and I had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes.

Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called andquot;Burning CD's for Dummiesandquot;, it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you

If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).

So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.

Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.

If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. 

A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.

I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old.  Wanted to update.  I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features.  Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing.  Otherwise it's a wonderful program.  Highly recommended!!

This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.

Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics.

 If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly

I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.    

I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing.  And that's just what you get.  In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!).  And all on 1 DVD-ROM.  

True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run.  It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller.  

$50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything.  And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it!

This set has got everything.  Almost every major Spider-man moment is in this collection.  From Spider-man's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, his wedding, and not to forget those great super-villain battles with the Green Goblin and Venom.

Each issue is scanned in .pdf format.  It has all the original colors, ads, and fan mail printed.  They are all organized by year and it says they are all printable.  If you are looking for the entire Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.'s run, here it is.  It is great to see where Todd Mcfarlane, the creator of Spawn got his start on old webhead.   J. Michael Strackzynski, the writer of Babylon 5 also takes a crack at Spider-man's life.  

The collection covers the beginning from Amazing Fantasy #15 to Amazing Spiderman #531, which is around the start of Marvel's Civil War.

Instead of spending thousands of dollars on purchasing back issues, you can own this entire collection for around $40-$45.  If you have the ink, you can print out any issue to your heart's desire.

The only drawbacks are around the 80s when several spider-man books begin to crossover.  You only get a part of the story in Kraven's Last Hunt or Maximum Carnage.  One major moment of Spider-man's life is left out, where he fights Harry Osborn as Green Goblin. The conclusion of that story took place in The Spectacular Spider-man title.  That problem is going to fixed in the future as GIT Corp. has plans to release a complementary collection  dvd that includes The Spectacular Spider-man, Web of Spiderman, and Peter Parker:  Spider-man.  They say on the boards that it will be out by fall of next year, but you never know with this company.  I waited about six months for this dvd after it was delayed from its original release date from march.

Now that I have it, I cannot wait to dig into the mythos of the old webhead.  I recommend this to anyone who loves comics and loves Spider-man.

Be sure to look out for the Ultimate Spider-man collection and there are a few others like the Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man, and Captain America collections that are due out next year

My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment

Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  

And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).

But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor

All I have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars.  Or about 40 years worth.  That's like a dollar a year.  You do the math...it's an amazing deal.  Also, quality is great and you can print them if you want

I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.  

If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)

While I love the content and the overall idea, it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging. All you get, outside of the outer box, is a cd in a paper envelope. No jewel case, book, insert, etc.......perhaps it's on the cd

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice and ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text and paragraph and fill and stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone

I was waiting for CS2 after using the CS. There are too many problems in CS. And I am very happy with CS2 now. The software is a lot easier to use, less problems. I have been using illustrator since illustrator 4. CS2 is definitly better than ever!

Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.

Why ruin things with an upgrade

OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram and 80 Gig HD shared on network and a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )

!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!

I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?
As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.
It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.

******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********

WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.

LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!

No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.
Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?

I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.

Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.

But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us

Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.

To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.

Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software

I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.

To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at JandR, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)

A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...

Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites.

You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. 
I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. 
I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.

As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  

I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.

I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.

One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.

Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.

So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!

I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean

I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.

This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.

However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.

I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course

I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.

I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.

Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website.

ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb

i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .

I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website

I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!

Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied

  My experience with this software as well as the company has been extremely positive. I ordered this program a little over a month ago. When I first received it from Amazon, I was amazed at the shear size of the program. It has a HUGE 1,300 page book with all the images and categories for easy reference. It also comes with 34 CDs that are loaded with images. This software is truly the largest set of art I have ever seen!
  Dealing with Nova Development is as easy to use as their software! When I first opened the box I was a little overwhelmed with the whole thing, so I called tech support. I may have waited a whole 20 seconds before I began speaking with a technician. They walked me through the install and how to use the clip art. They were professional and courteous.
  This software gets an A+ in my book!.

I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked.

I run the after school program at the local JR high where i work. We try to push the importance of computer skills on the children. I just upgraded to the 800,000 clip art library. We use these images for just about every project. I have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it!!!

Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.

One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.

If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.

Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.

To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.

Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!

Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.

Well worth the $99.00

...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.

The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. 

Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.

If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did

This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game

I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.
I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine

Not a complicated application, but it successfully repartitioned a 100G drive into 3rds on a new Lenovo laptop with XP SP2.  I would recommend using the DOS version which you can get just by booting on the CD.  Requires no install, you can simply boot, make the changes, and it is done.  Seems to be very straightforward and I would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with Windows running

I installed a WD 320G usb drive to use as a backup drive. I used the HD backup software to do auto backups. Unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and I could not use it as you would a normal drive (Drag n drop)or access a particular file.   I used Partition Magic to reclaim my USB drive and in the process I partitioned the drive. The drive now works as I want it to I have control!

Partition Magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job.

I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it

Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!!  And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep.  This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale.  There are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements.

I won't include my website URL here, but I'm a professional photographer, who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions. I've been using Photoshop since version 5.0, roughly 6-7 years.

Frankly, I'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of Photoshop CS2, and that overall the product only gets three stars. I understand all the frustration, though. Even on a top-of-the-line machine, "PS CS2" can be slow at times. However, in my case, that's because I'm working on incredibly large files. 

For example, my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images. By the time multiple layers are added in PS, one image file can be 500 MB - 1 GB in size. This is exactly why I have a dual-Opteron system with 4 GB of RAM: so I can work on these monster files in Photoshop!

For me, Photoshop is a must-have. There are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what I want to get done. I don't even want to mention all the advanced features that I use on a daily basis, frankly because that's part of my edge as a professional. I've spent over five years working in PS everyday, and have carefully studied several advanced books on PS. The learning curve is long, but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards.

Yeah, Adobe's got some major improvements to make, along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned. For me, the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory. And I would agree with other reviewers here that for most people, the full Photoshop CS2 is probably a waste of money. Photoshop Elements is probably a better way to go, though I haven't used it personally. I know a good web designer who uses Paint Shop Pro, and who seems to be happy.

IMHO, some people are probably drawn to Photoshop the way others are drawn to AutoCad or Solidworks or 3D Studio Max. All these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user. You can't make a career out of PS Elements, or Paint Shop Pro, or GIMP, or whatever else other reviewers may mention. PS CS2 is "the standard" for image manipulation

Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve

I have Fireworks, Corel Paint, and now CS2 to choose from. Perhaps it's my familiarity with PhotoShop that makes me so partial to it, but I feel it's the best imagery software on the market. I upgraded to this from PS7, so I missed out on CS, but from what I can tell, this is the smoothest-running version yet. I've not encountered any problems with system or support... I guess everyone's experience is different. But this is great software, and the Vanishing Point feature is just brilliant

The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel

Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast.  Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation;
Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens.  With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer

This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! 

There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.

I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.

I was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product -- it's as we we've purchased entirely different programs. In my experience with this software, I've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing, and the card selection and customization is second to none. 

There have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we've customized them countless ways -- adding and editing photos, moving text, sending ecards, you name it! Navigating within the art studio is very intuitive.

Printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great. Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had the problem of having to re-configure every time I print. We set it up once and that was it. I've printed on card stock paper, which turns out gorgeous, and we've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size A2 envelopes (this is a great printing option if you don't want to buy card stock paper!).

I've used this software on all of my computers, have recommended it to many people, and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems. I highly recommend it. It's a fun program, the recipients will love their customized cards, and it will save you money in the long run

This suite of applications is excellent.

They run much faster on my Mac than even the equivalent Mac programs.

I love them and use them quite happily every single day. 

A great value for students and teachers

I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past

I followed all instructions before I attempted to do an upgrade from Windows Me to Windows XP - infact, the more I read the more I was told to do a clean upgrade.  So, I did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and I got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth. I love what it gave me. Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program

I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.

An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.

In Response to Linux Users-
Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.

For Mac Users-
Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's

I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.

Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.

I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.

Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars

Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.

I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.

This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.

I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).

If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again

I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. 

I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..

Definitely worth the upgrade

Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice

First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.

Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.

You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  

For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.

All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.

You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).

For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.
OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.
In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.
Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice and ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. 

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! 

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text and paragraph and fill and stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. 

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. 

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. 

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.

I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD

This is a good software for casual use (hiking, biking, geocaching), but not without issues. On the positive side, it definitely beats all non-digital (scanned USGS maps) alternatives. The level of details is good enough(how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet?). The fact that maps are digitally generated (with vectors I believe) makes all the labels clear at any scale. It has two advantages over its main "digital" competitor, NG Topo. First, all of the US is on one DVD for the price of separate state/region CDs from NG. And second, it is available. I could not even find NG's Northeast edition anywhere on the web! One might think NH and ME are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations.

Now the few negatives. The Exchange feature with GPS is flaky. Sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my Garmin. Part of it could be that low and mid range GPS still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with COM-to-USB adapter (beats me why Garmin can't make all their GPS with USB in this day and age). In any case, regardless of whose  fault it is, it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly.

The second problem I noticed was with the 3-D window. It clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if I do a lot of rapid rescaling. I ended up just closing that window, since it is pretty much for "coolness" and does not add any real topographical value.

Finally, I had a problem with Delorme's service. I purchased it from Amazon with a rebate offer. However, a month after submitting the necessary info I received a card from Delorme stating that the bar code I sent was not a UPC code. The box only had one bar code on it so I am not sure how I could have made a mistake. They requested that I send a correct one, but with the code cut out and gone, how do they expect me to come up with one?! I feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it. I would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem.

There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.

It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.

I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.

The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system

I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....

I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  

First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?
Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.

Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!

New Features in Acrobat 7
*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.
*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!
*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.
*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.

More About Acrobat
Although many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  

Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.

This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.

In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.

Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  

Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.

For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.
Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.
Summary
I would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.
This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.
Testing Setup
To conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:
PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)
Epson Scanner/Fax/Printer
HP LaserJet 8150DN Printer
For software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:
MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)
Photoshop CS

I'm a longtime Mac user and for re-naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iView Media Pro is the best, I really like the feature that let's you produce and publish on-line galleries of your images, without any code or html experience, using only a very simpe interface and you're ready to go.

For the full-time photographer or amateur, I highly recomend it

This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. 

The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect

Tighter Integration Now Possible with InDesign CS2

Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.

I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. 

I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.

An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.

Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.

InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.

Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.

As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.

If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.

This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago

I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program

I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.

I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done

I have been playing the Nancy Drew games for a few years now, and have found that with each one the graphics, intrigue and fun just keep getting better and better.

In "Danger by Design" Nancy agrees to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette's House of Fashion.  He's nervous because Minette had begun acting very strangely and had fallen way behind on her new Spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture.

Once there, Nancy becomes aware of several threatening letters the designer had received, as well as a number of rumors concerning artwork that had been stolen during World War II that may be hidden in the old Wind Mill that now serves as Minette's House of Fashion.  Could they be related some how?

As Nancy Drew, you will find yourself snooping around for clues, working to earn the money needed to buy several needed items, solving various puzzles, and ultimately putting all the information together to solve the mysteries surrounding Minette and the stolen artwork.

Overall, I loved "Danger by Design".  It has the best graphics to date for an ND game and it was great fun to play.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed playing other such games, as well as those who enjoyed (or are enjoying) reading the ND series.

If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).

So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.

Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.

If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. 

A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.

This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.

Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics.

 If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly

My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment

Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  

And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).

But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor

I've tried this on two different mac computers: an emac desktop and  an ibook G4, it runs perfectly on both. I see that some people are having problems, I'll see if I can help with that at the end of the review.
I'm a huge x-men fan, but can't afford to buy a bunch of back-issues. The essential book collections are affordable, but they're printed in black and white. With this one disc you get almost 500 uncanny issues, including annuals, all are high-quality scan in's. The disc also has a nice little bio section, and comes with the neccessary adobe software. The one down-side is that you miss out on he tie-in issues, whick gets irritating mid-90's, but I'm not docking a star for that because   what you get is well worth the price, and it's clearly stated in the description that this is strictly "uncanny". 
OK, for those of you having trouble getting it to run w/ a mac here's the process:load cd, click cd image on your desktop twice. You'll get a finder window w/ various files/folders, one will have install on it, this should be the adobe software, follow the installation instructions, and move your new adobe reader to applications when finished, restart your computer. Once re-started load the cd again, open adobe reader 6.0 click the folder image in the upper left-hand corner you should have a finder-type window, go to desktop, click on x-men and choose start.pdf. You should be good to go. HT

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice and ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text and paragraph and fill and stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone

I was waiting for CS2 after using the CS. There are too many problems in CS. And I am very happy with CS2 now. The software is a lot easier to use, less problems. I have been using illustrator since illustrator 4. CS2 is definitly better than ever!

Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.

Why ruin things with an upgrade

OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram and 80 Gig HD shared on network and a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )

!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!

I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?
As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.
It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.

******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********

WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.

LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!

No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.
Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?

I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.

Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.

But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us

Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.

To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.

Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software

I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.

To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at JandR, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)

A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...

Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites.

You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. 
I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. 
I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.

As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  

I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.

I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.

One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.

Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.

So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!

I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.

Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.

I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.
I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.

It does the basic job well.  The calibration runs smoothly and accurately.  Hardware looks and feels solid.  My two completely different brand, size and age CRT monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side. 
 
User interface is merely adequate.  Pop up help instructions are better than many I have seen.  You will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work (the hardwired buttons on the monitor, not software).  In order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over.  Sometimes you can use "back" within the calibration, sometimes you must start over.  Also the separate "profile chooser" utility software, has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier.  You can see it with windows display properties, but it may not appear in the profile chooser list.

Dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version.  Yes, it does dual monitors, but with an asterisk.  It will create separate profiles, but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards.  If you have a single video card with dual outputs, it will load the same profile (the last one you created) to both monitors at startup.  This quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk (and blames windows for the problem), but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material, catalogs,  or on the box.  Fortunately there is a work around (not documented) at least with my particular video card and running XP.  After windows opens, you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor.  You may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default. 

Once it's all set up, running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure, but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles.  And check it after you open the application.  I've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time.

This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.

However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.

I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course

I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.

It is wondeful software.  Simple, easy to use, user-friendly, and very accurate in the pronunciation.

Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website.

ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb

I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.

The bad stuff:

First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.

Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.

Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).

Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. 

Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.

Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.

Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.

Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.

Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.

Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.

Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.

Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.

Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.

Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.

Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:

First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.

Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.

Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.

In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.

There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.

This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose.

i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .

I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website

This one is definately the best out of all of the previous ACID Music programs.  It has a ton of loops, a really cool looking skin, and much more options than in ACID 1.0 or 2.0.  It comes with two CDs.  One of them has the application on it with some loops and the other CD has nothing but loops and demo songs!  It has over 1,600 unique loops!  Definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous ACID Musics

This is a good package for backing up your PC.  Fairly intuitive, although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so I could select the right stuff to backup.  It uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup.  The downside of that is you can't just select a file to restore, you must go through the restore process.  You can select a single file, but it takes a bit of time.  Runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won't interfere with your current work.
