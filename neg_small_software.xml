The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.      

I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's

My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.

What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.

The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program. 

Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!

I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars

I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed

They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.
What a poor effort!

I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start

I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.
It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.
PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover

This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge.  All of the same info is on the net for free.

This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you.

This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.  He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product... but scams seem to be his thing.  AVOID!!  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.  

This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.  He is an embarrasement to his company and his family.  At least a mugger steals from me face to face... this snake is sneaky about it

Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review.
These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone. 
If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs. 
(My apologies to grandmothers with corded, dial, yellow wall phones). (Actually, I kinda wish I had one!)

When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use

I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable

Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)
So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it.

This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.

Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!

I downgraded back to Irritator 10

I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. 
When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service

I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.
However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.

I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right.

The only redeeming quality about this GPS system is that it's cheap.  I used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after I got it.  The navigation is poor. I found that I often had to look over to the laptop screen because I was "off route" so often due to the poor maps. The system repeated the same annoying problems that I see in other feedback.

1) The unit would show me being off the road even though I was on an Interstate. In this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around. 

2) It directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction.  

3) It could not locate a POI that turned out to be a few hundred yards away  

4) It often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination  

5) It doesn't provide a chime when it's time for a turn.  It will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead, but that might be the last time you hear an instruction.

6) In one case, it got me to my destination (at least close enough) but couldn't guide me back to my starting point.

The GPS receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well. But the maps are poor, as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980's computer generated voice.

If you're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this ISN'T it.

This is going back asap.

I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.  

The summary of this product is that it is "highly unusable".  You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again.  Yes, you can "manage" you way with this product.  However it is not worth your time and money.

And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on!

I have used MS streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year. It has some map errors that I wish were updated. I read that The Delorme Street Atlas was far superior, so I bought it. It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems. Not only is the mapping way out of date (Many years) Microsoft Streets and trips 2006 Maps are far more up to date. On many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road doesn't exist in that direction. It doesn't even know the name of some very old roads Displays..."Unknown Name" While driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that I am driving 30 feet below. The program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a U-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp. I have used Microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable. The Delorme is very confusing and frustrating. I'm sending it back for a full refund

There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted. This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought. I did not do much research. I think the data may be in there, but I could not learn how to make it work. The interface is horrific - unusable. Don't do it

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money

I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.
Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)
So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund.

By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without. 

Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.
Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.

I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.

Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.

Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.

I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.

I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.    

   I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.

I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.

First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.  

Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).

Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.

Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.

On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)

Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..

Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. 

However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..

Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.

Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.

As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.

While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility.

I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly

I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived! 

I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost

JUNK! I am a professional photographer and have used 2.0 for years for quick fixes and easy additions, thinking they might have made some improvements to make life easier... I was wrong. This program is a step back. I was a refund! I don't know who is writing they like this new version, but buyer beware! Laur

I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...).  Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the "this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down".  I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far.  I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed.  I am running windows 98SE.  I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible).  It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer.

The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims andquot;4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasionsandquot;. That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly andquot;cards for all occasionsandquot; means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own

I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE.

I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME. I wanted to upgrade it, so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade. I have another computer that came with XP built in, and I like that system a lot.

Well, before I purchased this software, I specifically asked the manager at CompUSA if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP. I was very specific. "No problem!" he told me, "It works great!"

NONSENSE!

Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop:
1. My touch pad stopped working.
2. My PCI bus started getting errors.
3. My wireless network card (D-Link GW-630) stopped working.

And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!

I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at Microsoft, uninstalling and re-installing the software, being put on hold, reinstalling drivers, restarting the computer over and over and over and over again... Six extremely frustrating hours!

Finally, the tech support people told me to uninstall the software. They said I should return the software to CompUSA.

Now for the fun part. CompUSA refused to take it back!!! After arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great, all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product. Then the manager said my system must not be compatible. Well, I showed him the "System Requirements" on the box, where it says "Windows ME."  According to the box, my laptop is perfectly compatible!  But apparently it's not.

Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP. Well, intyeresting he says that now!  I reminded him about our conversation!!!

I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.

In the end, I am stuck with software that does not work.

Learn from my trials. Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME. Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system

Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot. 

Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features). 

For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") . 

In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.) 

Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP! 

There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management. 

Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)

Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone

In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.  

For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment.

Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images.

These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around

First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.

But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.

It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy.

This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.  

I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant

This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.

I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download. 

I purchased the software on Aug 3 and called customer support, they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue.  They were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans.  Microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support, those that know the basics and those that know more. they asked me to set up a time span when I would like to receive a call from the "teir II" agents, I chose 6-9pm.  I received several calls over the next two weeks, all of them were outside of the specified time.  I missed several of them because I have a career and a life. 

When I finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue.  Here it was, two weeks after I purchased the software, I still did not have what I needed.  I was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software.  I called in several times druing the ordeal and the "teir I" agents just told me that I have to wait for the call, "they'll get to it when they get to it."  I was very upset with the customer support, I have no idea how the product is, but the customer support is just horrible.  Go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the "post your own thoughts" page through member accounts, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue.  I have since purchased other software that cover what Microsoft says it will with onecare.  I did not have one problem with these installs.  

Please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system (seperate from onecare).  This costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare

This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money

1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper.  Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.

2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect.  It turns out that this is exactly the same software!

I strongly recommend looking for something better

I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.

The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.

As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.

Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.

Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).

All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)

Cheers.

Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs.
Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it.
Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free.
Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!

The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer".
With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!

As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it.
Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs.
So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs.
Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed.
Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished.
This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.

It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months.
Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span.
It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.

Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.

Final note -

Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/features
Linux: Free

Windows: One per computer, or buy more licenses
Linux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for life

Windows: Boring; basic programs
Linux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.

Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC.
Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!

Windows: Constantly gets attacked by viruses
Linux: Quite a lot safer

Windows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be some
Linux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OS

That's just some of the reasons why I love linux

That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.

What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.

As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:

Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....

I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.

As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical

I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user

It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K

First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility. 
Overall, I feel that I paid too much for this operating system.

There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon

...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.

Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that

I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software. 
I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.

I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program

I used Easy Creator 4 for years. Bought new computers so bought Easy Creator 6. It will not work on 2 E-Machines with XP. It wipes out CD rom drive so that it is unusable. I requested tech support 6/12/06. It's 7/15/06 and I am still waiting. I uninstalled it. I found Easy Creator 5 platinum on Amazon and ordered it. It works

This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company

Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.
Went to website, downloaded patch. It said I had the latest patch already.
Everywhere you go on the roxio website, it tells you you can upgrade to version 8 for $20 off. It still is more than $50 and if Version 6 doesn't work, why would I throw more money at the problem?

I could find no usefull information on the website and no way to speak to someone.

I took it back to Best Buy. They said they could only exchange it for the same piece of junk. I went next door to Staples and they said if I bought software that does not work from them, they would refund my money if I bought it back within 14 days. So, I found a new source for software.

Pros: 
It did not crash my laptop
It did not cause the modem to dial international calls

Cons:
Doesn't work
no tech support
doesn't work
no tech suppor

I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features

I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!
I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.
DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS

It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money. 

Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical.

After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is!

As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.

I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.    

A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio?

The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.

Roxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to "encourage" (read "browbeat") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.     

It is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting "Illegal Request" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that "EASY" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.    

I now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do "drag and drop" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.

It shouldn't be called "EASY CD Creator". Perhaps "IRRITATING" CD Creator would be more appropriate. 

In Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few "BLACK HOLES"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.

This program is average to below average in it's abilities.

That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.
Why? because Roxio's  support bites!

You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;
whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop. 

I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.

It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access. 
Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.
Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.

NO MORE.

What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.
[EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].

Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,
[which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc];
 apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.

When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games
are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.

If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.
But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.
Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER. 
That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.
Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.

IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.

If a company won't provide access to PATCHES, 
even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches] 
AND they  don't offer any type of 
FTP site  as a download backup  option, then 
I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.

I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.
[Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. 
When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out.
 
Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.

Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.

Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.

The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support

Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot

Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.

It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.

I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)

It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.

Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.

Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size.

Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country?

I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar.

Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy.

The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it.

A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier

Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents.
I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT

Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!

"Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)

MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!) 

OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)

Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally

While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.

I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.

50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. 

Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.

Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware. 

Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software.

I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:

1.  When the program works, it's superb.

2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.

For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.

Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.

My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle

I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.

There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.

Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... 

Hold on ... let me start again.

Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... 

Dang it! Give me a few minutes here ... 

Pinnacle Studio can assist ... 

(Samuel L Jackson-styled expletive) ... how many times is this gonna happen? Start and stop! Start and stop! Enough already!

One more time. Now, what was I saying? 

Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running.

Got the idea?

Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions. 

After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes.

If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere

Let me sum up this software "total junk"

Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.

They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.

I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.

They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.

If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.

Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked

I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs.  What a disappointment this "upgrade" has been.  Crash after crash.  What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could "help" them develop a better product.  This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100.  Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product.  I want a product that works when I purchase it.

Lesson learned.  Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away

I was very disappointed with this program. But I was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases. Even so, the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating. I learned more Icelandic (along with correct pronounciations) while in Iceland than I did with this program. And besides, anyone under the age of 50 in Iceland speaks English

I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special.

An Internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates.  Why would they give you something for nothing?  

I have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items.  

This "free" software could cost you $30 if the company decides they don't want to pay

Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good

I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work

  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something. 
  Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.
  Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF

I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.

In the end, I returned my copy to VCom, though to date I have not yet received a refund

I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.

I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out

Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan

The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out

I received this item today and was surprised
1) It was shipped from overseas (UK)
2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought
3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc
4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support
5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected

In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).

It would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver. Be prepared for possible frustrations with this product, with little support from the manufacturer. I cannot report on other features of the software because I was never able to produce even the walls of a structure

3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry

I trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that I am dumbfounded and left speechless.  During backup process I selected about 15GB of info to backup, spanning 4 DVDs.  Everything looked fine, except for TWO (2) simple errors that I received, indicating that those related files may not have been copied/backed up properly.  I figured no big deal, 2 files/errors out 15GB, I could handle that.  Based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly (simple pictures, videos, mp3 files and Financial Files to include previous years tax files), I then proceeded to slick my drive.  Remember, only 2 simple, benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process.  Everything looked great.

During the restore process, I then received numerous errors, each of them requiring me to click 'Yes' when asked if I wanted to proceed.  I got tired of clicking Yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no.  When you click 'no', EVERYTHING is undone; there is no 'ignore all' function so I had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me.  I then selected a smaller group of files to have restored, only the 'My Documents' folder but ran into the same situation.  Eventually I ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through.  Hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored.  My guess is approximately 2/3 or 3/4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it.

I had the latest update applied to the program, so that should not be the cause.  I would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as I would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches, frustrations and an investment of hours, no DAYS of my time.

The program has been recently purchased by Microsoft for inclusion in the Vista OS, I imagine.  It will do well as a Microsoft product, as it fails to deliver upon its promises

All I wanted was a way to identify some files, remember which ones so every time I wanted to backup, I would press "go" and the backup would start. AlohaBob was too "smart" for my use. First, it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up.  I indicate that I want to select my own files (which it lets me think I can do). Then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no, no, no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if I had selected the "smart find". I then manually select my files (great!!). In trying to save the "template" of what files I wanted to backup, it requires that I make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency (YUK!!). I want to back up when I get to it (about once a month, not when it wants to -- I am backing up to a DVD which I need to put in the drive).  OK, so now I am over that and the backup begins - GREAT!!!  Upon returning into the application a month later, I can not select my saved "template" to "run now", it will run when it is scheduled to run :(  So...I need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up.  I exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to "add" the features I described.  Oh well - it looked like such a promising product.  Now I need to find another that satisfies my requirements

I really dislike this software.  I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way.  First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are "C:" or "ALL".  I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult.  Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up.  Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later!  And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later.  Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over.

800,000 images without keywords - the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional .tif's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector.  The high res images aren't, the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and I've gotten far more use out of a 50,000 image collection b/c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection.

If you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image - then this collection is for you.  If you want to have any sort of search capabilites, look elsewhere

I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product.  There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call.  I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.  They offer only email support, but don't write back.  If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens

This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children

The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money

I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.
Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)
So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund.

By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without. 

Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.
Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.

I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.

Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.

Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.

This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge.  All of the same info is on the net for free.

This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you.

This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.  He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product... but scams seem to be his thing.  AVOID!!  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.  

This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.  He is an embarrasement to his company and his family.  At least a mugger steals from me face to face... this snake is sneaky about it

Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review.
These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone. 
If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs.

I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.

I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.    

   I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.

I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.

First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.  

Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).

Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.

Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.

On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)

I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable

Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..

Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. 

However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..

Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.

Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.

As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.

While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility.

I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly

I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived! 

I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost

I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...).  Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the "this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down".  I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far.  I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed.  I am running windows 98SE.  I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible).  It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer.

The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims andquot;4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasionsandquot;. That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly andquot;cards for all occasionsandquot; means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own

I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE.

I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME. I wanted to upgrade it, so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade. I have another computer that came with XP built in, and I like that system a lot.

Well, before I purchased this software, I specifically asked the manager at CompUSA if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP. I was very specific. "No problem!" he told me, "It works great!"

NONSENSE!

Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop:
1. My touch pad stopped working.
2. My PCI bus started getting errors.
3. My wireless network card (D-Link GW-630) stopped working.

And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!

I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at Microsoft, uninstalling and re-installing the software, being put on hold, reinstalling drivers, restarting the computer over and over and over and over again... Six extremely frustrating hours!

Finally, the tech support people told me to uninstall the software. They said I should return the software to CompUSA.

Now for the fun part. CompUSA refused to take it back!!! After arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great, all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product. Then the manager said my system must not be compatible. Well, I showed him the "System Requirements" on the box, where it says "Windows ME."  According to the box, my laptop is perfectly compatible!  But apparently it's not.

Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP. Well, intyeresting he says that now!  I reminded him about our conversation!!!

I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.

In the end, I am stuck with software that does not work.

Learn from my trials. Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME. Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system

Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot. 

Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features). 

For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") . 

In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.) 

Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP! 

There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management. 

Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)

Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone

In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.  

For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment.

Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images.

These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around

First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.

But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.

It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy.

This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.  

I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant

This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.

I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download. 

I purchased the software on Aug 3 and called customer support, they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue.  They were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans.  Microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support, those that know the basics and those that know more. they asked me to set up a time span when I would like to receive a call from the "teir II" agents, I chose 6-9pm.  I received several calls over the next two weeks, all of them were outside of the specified time.  I missed several of them because I have a career and a life. 

When I finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue.  Here it was, two weeks after I purchased the software, I still did not have what I needed.  I was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software.  I called in several times druing the ordeal and the "teir I" agents just told me that I have to wait for the call, "they'll get to it when they get to it."  I was very upset with the customer support, I have no idea how the product is, but the customer support is just horrible.  Go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the "post your own thoughts" page through member accounts, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue.  I have since purchased other software that cover what Microsoft says it will with onecare.  I did not have one problem with these installs.  

Please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system (seperate from onecare).  This costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare

Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)
So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it.

This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.

Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!

I downgraded back to Irritator 10

I bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use. I am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy! It was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you're a professional architect/ computer genius

This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money

1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper.  Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.

2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect.  It turns out that this is exactly the same software!

I strongly recommend looking for something better

I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.

The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.

As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.

Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.

Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).

All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)

Cheers.

Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs.
Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it.
Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free.
Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!

The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer".
With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!

As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it.
Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs.
So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs.
Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed.
Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished.
This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.

It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months.
Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span.
It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.

Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.

Final note -

Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/features
Linux: Free

Windows: One per computer, or buy more licenses
Linux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for life

Windows: Boring; basic programs
Linux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.

Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC.
Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!

Windows: Constantly gets attacked by viruses
Linux: Quite a lot safer

Windows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be some
Linux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OS

That's just some of the reasons why I love linux

The Mac OS, $129 list, often cheaper, doesn't get viruses, worms, malware, etc and probably runs all the software you do on a PC, with the exception of some games. Go to a Mac Store and try it for yourself

That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.

<review_text>
What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.

As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:

Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....

I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.

As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical

I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user

It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K

First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility. 
Overall, I feel that I paid too much for this operating system.

There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon

I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. 
When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service

I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.
However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.

I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right.

...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.

Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that

I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software. 
I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.

I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program

This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company

Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.
Went to website, downloaded patch. It said I had the latest patch already.
Everywhere you go on the roxio website, it tells you you can upgrade to version 8 for $20 off. It still is more than $50 and if Version 6 doesn't work, why would I throw more money at the problem?

I could find no usefull information on the website and no way to speak to someone.

I took it back to Best Buy. They said they could only exchange it for the same piece of junk. I went next door to Staples and they said if I bought software that does not work from them, they would refund my money if I bought it back within 14 days. So, I found a new source for software.

Pros: 
It did not crash my laptop
It did not cause the modem to dial international calls

Cons:
Doesn't work
no tech support
doesn't work
no tech suppor

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features

I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!
I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.
DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS

It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money. 

Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical.

After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is!

As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.

I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.    

A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio?

The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.

Roxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to "encourage" (read "browbeat") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.     

It is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting "Illegal Request" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that "EASY" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.    

I now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do "drag and drop" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.

It shouldn't be called "EASY CD Creator". Perhaps "IRRITATING" CD Creator would be more appropriate. 

In Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few "BLACK HOLES"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.

This program is average to below average in it's abilities.

That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.
Why? because Roxio's  support bites!

You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;
whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop. 

I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.

It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access. 
Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.
Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.

NO MORE.

What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.
[EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].

Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,
[which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc];
 apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.

When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games
are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.

If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.
But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.
Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER. 
That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.
Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.

IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.

If a company won't provide access to PATCHES, 
even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches] 
AND they  don't offer any type of 
FTP site  as a download backup  option, then 
I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.

I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.
[Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. 
When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out.
 
Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.

Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.

Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.

The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.

The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.      

I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's

My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.

What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.

The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program. 

Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!

I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars

I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed

They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.

I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start

I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.
It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.
PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover

Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. 
(For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)

If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support

Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot

Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.

It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.

I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)

It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.

Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.

Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size.

Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country?

I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar.

Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy.

The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it.

A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier

Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents.
I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT

Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!

"Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)

MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!) 

OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)

Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally

While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.

I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.

50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. 

Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.

Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware. 

Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software.

I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:

1.  When the program works, it's superb.

2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.

For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.

Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.

My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle

I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.

There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.
